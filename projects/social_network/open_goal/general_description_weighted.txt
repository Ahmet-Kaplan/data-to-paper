* Rationale:
The dataset quantifies the US Congress's social media interactions, specifically focusing on Twitter. A weighted directed graph is formed of social interactions (edges) among Congress members (nodes). In addition, each member is characterized by three properties: Represented State, Political Party, and Chamber.

* Data Collection and Network Construction:
The dataset encapsulates the Twitter interaction network of the 117th United States Congress. Tweeter data of Congress members, from both the House and the Senate, were harvested for the period of February 9 to June 9, 2022 (using the Twitter API).

- `Nodes`. Nodes represent Congress members. Each node is designated an integer node ID (0, 1, 2, ...) which corresponds to a row in `congress_members.csv`, providing the member's Represented State, Political Party, and Chamber.
Members with fewer than 100 tweets were excluded from the network.

- `Edges`. For two members i and j, we quantified the level to which member j engages with member i on Twitter. In particular, the weight of this edge represents the fraction of member j's tweets that engage with member i's tweets:

weight[i,j] = N_Engaging_Tweets[i,j] / N_Tweets[j]

where,

N_Tweets[j] is the total number of ALL tweets by member j (original tweets, retweets, quote tweets, or replies), including those that do not engage with Congress members.
N_Engaging_Tweets[i,j] is the number of member j's tweets that engage with member i's tweets, either through mentioning of another member's handle, or through retweeting, quote tweeting, or replying to another member's tweet.

An edge from j to is defined only if weight[i,j] > 0; namely an edge from j to i indicates that member j engaged at least once with member i on Twitter.

* Data analysis guidelines:
- Your analysis code should NOT create tables that include names of Congress members, or their Twitter handles.
- Your analysis code should NOT create tables that include names of States, or their two-letter abbreviations. The code may of course do statistical analysis of *properties* related to States, but should not single out specific states.
