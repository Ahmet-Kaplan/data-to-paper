This json file provides a sparse representation of the interaction matrix between members of the 115th US Congress on Twitter.
Downloaded from: `https://snap.stanford.edu/data/congress-twitter`

The file is a json dictionary with the following keys:

`outList`: list of lists such that outList[j] is a list of all nodes i engaged by j (P[i,j] > 0).
`outWeight`: The corresponding weights, P[i,j], for the connections in outList

Example file (for a network of n=4 nodes):
```json
{
"outList": [[1, 2], [0, 2, 3], [], [2]],
"outWeight": [[0.2, 0.1], [0.1, 0.2, 0.1], [], [0.2]],
"usernameList": ["user0", "user1", "user2", "user3"]
}
```

IMPORTANT NOTE: The network uses a sparse matrix representation, storing only non-zero entries.
Namely, for a given node j:

- `len(outList[j])`: Out-degree of node j (number of members engaged by j).

- `sum(outWeight[j])`: Total engagement of member j with other members (the fraction of all Tweets of member j that are engaging with Congress members).

- `sum(outWeight[j]) / (n - 1)`: Average engagement of member j with all other members (excluding self-engagement).

- `mean(outWeight[j])`: Average engagement of member j with only those members with whom j engages at all. Note: this is NOT the average engagement of member j with all members, which is provided by the sum instead.
