# ML Treatment Optimization Example Dataset

A dataset of pediatric patients, which received mechanical ventilation after undergoing surgery, including an x-ray-based determination of the optimal tracheal tube intubation depth and a set of personalized patient attributes to be used in machine learning and formula-based models to predict this optimal depth
### Source
Dataset and research goal are based on:
