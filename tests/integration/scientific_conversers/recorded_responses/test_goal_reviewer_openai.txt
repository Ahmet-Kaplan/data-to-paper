        "LLMResponse: ```\n# Research Goal:\nTo investigate the potential impact of maternal socio-economic status and age on the birth weight of newborns, considering gestational age as a mediating variable.\n\n# Hypothesis:\nMaternal socio-economic status and age have a significant interaction effect on the birth weight of newborns, with gestational age mediating this relationship.\n```",
        "LLMResponse: - There is an assumption regarding the availability of data related to maternal socio-economic status and specific details of maternal age and gestational age in the \"BIRTH_RECORDS.csv\" file. If such specific socio-economic data or detailed maternal age data are not included, the hypothesis might not be testable.\n  \n- To ensure the hypothesis fits the dataset, confirm that maternal socio-economic status, maternal age, and gestational age are indeed variables present in the dataset. If not, adjustment might be necessary to only include variables that are available.\n\n- Suggest modifying the hypothesis to:\n  ```\n  # Hypothesis: \n  Maternal age and gestational age have a significant interaction effect on the birth weight of newborns.\n  ```\n  This ensures reliance on variables commonly included in birth records (maternal age, gestational age, birth weight) without assuming additional socio-economic data.\n\n- While the interaction between socio-economic status, maternal age, and birth weight is interesting, focusing on commonly accessible data may yield a more achievable goal without sacrificing novelty:\n  ```\n  # Research Goal:\n  To investigate the potential impact of maternal age on the birth weight of newborns, considering gestational age as a mediating variable.\n  ```\n\nThis approach ensures you can work solely within the scope of the dataset provided while maintaining an interesting and concise research question focused on well-defined variables typically available in birth records.",
        "LLMResponse: Thank you for your feedback. Here's the revised research goal and hypothesis:\n\n```\n# Research Goal:\nTo investigate the potential impact of maternal age on the birth weight of newborns, considering gestational age as a mediating variable.\n\n# Hypothesis:\nMaternal age and gestational age have a significant interaction effect on the birth weight of newborns.\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that the research goal and hypothesis are achievable with the commonly accessible variables typically available in birth records."
