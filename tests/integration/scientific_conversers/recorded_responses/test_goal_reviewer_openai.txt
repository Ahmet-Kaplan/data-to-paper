    "Research Goal: \nTo investigate whether there is a relationship between gender and birth weight after accounting for the potential confounding effects of the mother's age.\n\nHypothesis: \nThe mean birth weight for male and female infants will differ after controlling for the mother's age, with female infants having a higher mean birth weight than male infants.",
    "```\nResearch Goal:\nTo examine whether there is an association between the gender of the newborn and the rate of preterm births, while considering the potential confounding effect of maternal age.\n\nHypothesis:\nAfter controlling for maternal age, it is hypothesized that there will be a significant difference in the rate of preterm births between male and female newborns, with one gender having a higher rate of preterm births than the other.\n```",
    "The research goal and hypothesis are appropriate and can be tested using only the provided dataset. The research goal is to examine the association between the gender of the newborn and the rate of preterm births, considering the potential confounding effect of maternal age. The hypothesis states that after controlling for maternal age, there will be a significant difference in the rate of preterm births between male and female newborns, with one gender having a higher rate of preterm births than the other.\n\nThe research goal does not require any changes."
