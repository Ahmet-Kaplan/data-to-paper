    "LLMResponse: ```\n# Research Goal: \nThe research goal is to understand the dynamics of birth rates and influencing factors, potentially uncovering patterns or trends that can be useful for social, health, and policy planning.\n\n# Hypothesis: \nThe hypothesis is that birth rates are influenced by complex multifactorial associations such as socio-economic indicators, health factors, and demographic variables. There might be a significant interaction effect between these variables influencing birth rates. For instance, birth rates could be higher in specific socio-economic classes, might be influenced by mother's health conditions, or vary significantly between different demographic groups.\n```",
    "LLMResponse: Bullet-point feedback on the Research Goal and Hypothesis:\n\n- The dataset provided is just \"BIRTH_RECORDS.csv\", hence any assumptions about data content cannot be made. We need to make sure the dataset contains enough socio-economic, health factors and demographic variables to test the hypothesis accurately. If not, the hypothesis would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n- The hypothesis provided is quite broad, as it includes socio-economic indicators, health factors, and demographic variables. It would be more manageable and concise to focus on fewer variables at first, for instance, only socio-economic or only health factors.\n- The novelty factor might be increased by focusing on a particular subset of the birth records, such as premature births, birth anomalies, twins, etc., and studying the factors influencing them.",
    "LLMResponse: Based on your feedback, I've adjusted the research goal and hypothesis as follows:\n\n```\n# Research Goal: \nThe goal is to delve into the dataset of birth records and determine specific patterns or trends that can shed light on birth rate dynamics. \n\n# Hypothesis: \nThe hypothesis posits that birth rates could vary significantly based on the month of the year, potentially due to factors like climate or cultural events. Specific trends might become apparent once the data is divided and analysed based on month segments.\n```"
