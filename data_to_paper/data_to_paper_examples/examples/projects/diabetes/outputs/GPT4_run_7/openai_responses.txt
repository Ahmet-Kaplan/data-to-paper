    "Sure, here's a simple Python script that performs some initial data exploration tasks.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read the data\ndf = pd.read_csv('diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv')\n\n# Open a file for writing\nwith open(\"data_exploration.txt\", \"w\") as text_file:\n\n    # Data Size\n    text_file.write(\"# Data Size\\n\")\n    text_file.write(\"Number of rows: {}\\n\".format(df.shape[0]))\n    text_file.write(\"Number of columns: {}\\n\".format(df.shape[1]))\n    text_file.write(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Summary Statistics\n    text_file.write(\"# Summary Statistics\\n\")\n    desc = df.describe(include='all')\n    text_file.write(\"{}\\n\".format(desc))\n    text_file.write(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Categorical Variables\n    text_file.write(\"# Categorical Variables\\n\")\n    categorical_vars = df.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns\n    for var in categorical_vars:\n        top = df[var].describe()['top']\n        text_file.write(\"Most common value for {}: {}\\n\".format(var, top))\n    text_file.write(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Missing Values\n    text_file.write(\"# Missing Values\\n\")\n    missing_values = df.isnull().sum()\n    text_file.write(\"{}\\n\".format(missing_values))\n    text_file.write(\"\\n\")\n```\n\nThis script writes the relevant information to `data_exploration.txt`. Note that it assumes you're running it in the same directory as the .csv file. If that's not the case, you'll need to specify the full path to the file."
