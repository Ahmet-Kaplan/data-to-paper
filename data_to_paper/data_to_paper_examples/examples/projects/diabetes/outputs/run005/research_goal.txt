Here is our Research Goal


Research Goal: 

To explore the relationship between fruit and vegetable consumption and the risk of developing diabetes, and whether this relationship is influenced by income level.

Hypothesis: 

Individuals with higher levels of fruit and vegetable consumption will have a lower risk of developing diabetes, and this association will be stronger among individuals with lower income levels compared to those with higher income levels.
