    "```\nResearch Goal: \nTo examine the association between lifestyle factors and the presence of diabetes among individuals in the dataset.\n\nHypothesis: \nThere is a significant association between physical activity and the presence of diabetes, such that individuals who engage in regular physical activity are less likely to have diabetes compared to those who are physically inactive.\n```",
    "The research goal does not require any changes.",
    "(1) Bullet-point review of relevant statistical issues:\n\n- Multiple comparisons: In our case, there is a potential issue of multiple comparisons as we are testing associations between multiple lifestyle factors and the presence of diabetes. We need to be aware of this issue and take appropriate measures to adjust for multiple comparisons if necessary.\n\n- Confounding variables: It is important to consider potential confounding variables that may influence the association between physical activity and the presence of diabetes. The dataset provides several variables that can be adjusted for as potential confounders, such as age, sex, education, and income.\n\n- Dependencies between data points: There may be dependencies between data points due to the nature of the survey design. Individuals within the same household or geographic area could have correlated responses. We should consider clustering or stratification in our analysis to account for any potential dependencies.\n\n- Missing data points: According to the data exploration, there are no missing values in the dataset. However, if missing values were present, we would need to consider appropriate strategies for handling missing data, such as imputation or using valid statistical techniques that can handle missing values.\n\n- Other relevant statistical issues: We should also consider the assumptions of the statistical tests we plan to use, such as the normality of the data, linearity assumptions for regression analysis, and the potential for non-linearity or interactions.\n\n(2) Python dictionary mapping hypotheses to statistical tests:\n\n{\n \"There is a significant association between physical activity and the presence of diabetes\": \n \"Logistic regression with diabetes_binary as the dependent variable and PhysActivity as the independent variable, adjusting for potential confounders such as age, sex, education, and income\",\n}"
