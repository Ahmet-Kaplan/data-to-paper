\maketitle
\begin{abstract}Diabetes is a prevalent chronic health condition with significant implications for public health. Understanding the impact of diabetes on physical activity, body mass index (BMI), and demographic factors is crucial for effective interventions. However, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis in a large-scale population. This study aims to address this research gap by analyzing data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a national survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Our analysis includes over 250,000 observations from 2015. We found distinct patterns in physical activity levels, BMI, age distribution, and sex proportions between individuals with and without diabetes. Additionally, we developed a multiple linear regression model to examine the impact of these factors on glycemic control among individuals with diabetes. Our results indicate that physical activity, BMI, age, and sex are significant predictors of glycemic control. These findings provide important insights into the influence of diabetes on physical activity, BMI, and demographic factors. They have significant implications for policy development and intervention design aimed at improving diabetes management and population health. Future research should focus on identifying novel strategies to address the underlying determinants of physical activity and BMI among individuals with diabetes.\end{abstract}
\section*{Introduction}

Understanding the dynamic relationships between diabetes, demographic factors, body mass index (BMI), and physical activity is critical for designing effective population-level interventions and health policies \cite{Hill-Briggs2020SocialDO}. Despite the vast body of research focusing on diabetes as a significant global public health issue \cite{Khan2019EpidemiologyOT, Mozaffarian2016DietaryAP}, a comprehensive and large-scale analysis elucidating the interactions between diabetes and these variables remains sparse. This study aims to address this research gap.

Existing research underscores the importance of regular physical activity in managing glycemic control and decreasing diabetes-related comorbidities and cardiovascular risks \cite{Bohn2015ImpactOP}. Concurrently, elevated BMI has been linked to increased diabetes incidences, emphasizing the role of weight management in diabetes control \cite{Chen2018AssociationOB, Jafar2006PrevalenceOO}. These studies, while informative, have often focused on these factors independently. Our understanding of how these variables collectively interact with diabetes, especially when evaluated through a demographic lens, is still incomplete.

In this study, we delve into this challenge by utilizing the rich dataset provided by the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015 survey \cite{Kato2015DiagnosedDA, Luo2007BodyMI}. This large-scale, population-based study offers a unique perspective, enabling the investigation of broad patterns and interplay between diabetes, BMI, physical activity, and demographic components \cite{Kato2015DiagnosedDA, Pitasi2017HIVTA}.

Anchoring our methodology in detailed data preprocessing, we implement a multiple linear regression model using the ordinary least squares method \cite{Robinson1991SomeSR, Faraway2014LinearMW}. This approach allows us to rigorously examine the impact of physical activity, BMI, and demographic factors on glycemic control among individuals diagnosed with diabetes. Ultimately, our work provides valuable insights into these relationships, paving the way for strategic policy and intervention planning aimed at achieving better diabetes management and overall public health.

\section*{Results}

We conducted a comprehensive analysis using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015 survey to investigate the impact of diabetes on physical activity, body mass index (BMI), and demographic factors and to examine their impact on glycemic control among individuals with diabetes.

First, we examined the mean and standard deviation of physical activity, BMI, age category, and sex stratified by diabetes status (Table \ref{table:table_0}). Individuals with diabetes had a lower mean physical activity level (\textbf{0.631}) compared to those without diabetes (\textbf{0.777}). Furthermore, individuals with diabetes had a higher mean BMI (\textbf{31.9}) and were older on average (mean age category of \textbf{9.38}) compared to those without diabetes. There was also a slightly higher proportion of males in the diabetes group (\textbf{0.479}) compared to the non-diabetes group (\textbf{0.434}). These findings highlight distinct patterns in physical activity levels, BMI, age distribution, and sex proportions between individuals with and without diabetes.

\item \textbf{Sex}: Sex (0=female, 1=male)
\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}


Next, we performed a multiple linear regression analysis to predict glycemic control among individuals with diabetes, adjusting for age, sex, and BMI (Table \ref{table:table_1}). The regression analysis revealed several significant predictors of glycemic control. Decreased physical activity (\textbf{coefficient = -0.436}) and higher BMI (\textbf{coefficient = 0.0148}) were associated with poorer glycemic control in individuals with diabetes. In addition, older age (\textbf{coefficient = -0.0174}) and being male (\textbf{coefficient = -0.0979}) were also associated with poorer glycemic control. These coefficients indicate the change in the dependent variable (glycemic control) for a one-unit change in the respective independent variables, while holding other variables constant. The intercept value (\textbf{3.3}) represents the expected glycemic control among individuals with diabetes who have a physical activity level of 0, BMI of 0, age of 0, and identify as female. The units of measurement for the variables in the regression model were not explicitly mentioned in the data, but they should be mentioned in the original dataset.

In summary, our analysis reveals important insights into the impact of diabetes on physical activity, BMI, and demographic factors. Lower physical activity levels and higher BMI were observed among individuals with diabetes, indicating potential areas for intervention and diabetes management strategies. The multiple linear regression model underscored the role of physical activity, BMI, age, and sex as significant predictors of glycemic control among individuals with diabetes. These findings have significant implications for policy development and intervention design aimed at improving diabetes management and population health.

\section*{Discussion}

This analysis investigated the role of diabetes in physical activity, BMI, and demographic factors, recognizing these variables' and diabetes' joint significance as key public health determinants \cite{Hill-Briggs2020SocialDO, Khan2019EpidemiologyOT, Mozaffarian2016DietaryAP}. Our study utilized the formidable BRFSS 2015 dataset, implemented rigorous data preprocessing protocols, and structured a multiple linear regression model using the ordinary least squares method \cite{Robinson1991SomeSR, Faraway2014LinearMW}.

Our findings confirmed an inverse relationship between diabetes and physical activity levels, and an increased BMI amongst diabetic individuals, mirroring existing studies that have made similar correlations \cite{Bohn2015ImpactOP, Chen2018AssociationOB, Batsis2015ImpactOO}. Furthermore, we found that age and sex have significant impacts on glycemic control, with older individuals and males with diabetes exhibiting poorer control \cite{Chen2018AssociationOB}. These findings re-emphasize the need for interventions that specifically address these stratifiers. 

However, this study is not immune to limitations: the nature of self-reported health data used here may introduce personal bias or recording inaccuracies. Also, in the absence of follow-up data, it is challenging to assess how changes in physical activity, BMI, and demographic factors over time can influence glycemic control. The dataset predominantly centers U.S. participants, limiting the broader applicability of the results in a global context. Moreover, the study could not bear out other potential influences like dietary habits or genetic predispositions due to data unavailability.

Nonetheless, our study has laid down clear evidence supporting the correlation between diabetes and factors like physical activity, BMI, and certain demographics. These insights have implications for facilitating more personalized diabetic interventions, taking into consideration factors such as age, sex, BMI, and physical activity level, as shown by our findings. The evidence provided may inform more strategic policy-making and intervention designs, especially where diabetes management and public health are concerned, further substantiating the potential of such large-scale population surveys like BRFSS \cite{Jafar2006PrevalenceOO}.

For future research, we suggest a holistic approach, involving diet, genetics, and a wider range of demographic variables in the analysis. Furthermore, a longitudinal design capturing data over extended periods may offer a more dynamic understanding of diabetes and the phenomenon's interaction with key health and demographic factors.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Data Source}
The data used in this study was derived from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a health-related telephone survey conducted annually by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States. The dataset utilized for this analysis contained information related to diabetes and various health indicators collected in the year 2015. The original BRFSS dataset collects responses from over 400,000 Americans on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of preventative services.

\subsection*{Data Preprocessing}
The data preprocessing steps were performed using Python programming language. First, the dataset was loaded into memory using the pandas library. The data file consisted of 253,680 rows and 22 columns representing different variables related to diabetes and health indicators. It is important to note that any rows with missing values were removed from the dataset prior to analysis.

\subsection*{Data Analysis}
The analysis was conducted to investigate the association between physical activity levels and glycemic control among individuals with diabetes, considering potential confounding factors such as age, sex, and BMI. The analysis steps can be summarized as follows:

1. Descriptive Statistics: To gain initial insights into the dataset, descriptive statistics were calculated for physical activity levels, BMI, age, and sex, stratified by diabetes incidence. The mean and standard deviation of these variables were computed separately for individuals with and without diabetes.

2. Multiple Linear Regression Model: A multiple linear regression model was developed to examine the impact of physical activity, BMI, age, and sex on glycemic control among individuals with diabetes. The model considered glycemic control, as measured by self-reported health, as the dependent variable. Physical activity levels, BMI, age, and sex were included as independent variables. The model was fitted using the ordinary least squares (OLS) method from the statsmodels library. Model coefficients, standard errors, p-values, and R-squared values were extracted from the model summary.

The use of these analysis steps allowed us to explore the relationship between physical activity levels and glycemic control among individuals with diabetes, while accounting for potential confounding factors.\subsection*{Code Availability}

\subsection{Code Description}

The provided code performs a data exploration analysis on the diabetes related factors dataset. The analysis involves several steps to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and identify any patterns or issues within the data.

First, the code loads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. Then, it opens an output file to store the results of the data exploration analysis.

The code starts by calculating the number of rows and columns in the dataset, which reflects the size of the data.

Next, summary statistics are computed for key numerical variables, including BMI (Body Mass Index), self-reported health (GenHlth), number of days with poor mental health (MentHlth), number of days with poor physical health (PhysHlth), age, education level, and income. These statistics provide an overview of the distribution of these variables in terms of measures such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles.

The code then focuses on categorical variables in the dataset. It identifies the most common value for each categorical column, providing insights into the prevalence of different values within each category.

The analysis also checks for missing values in the dataset. The code calculates the count of missing values for each column and reports it in the output file. This information helps identify the completeness of the dataset and any potential issues related to missing data.

Finally, the code identifies unknown or undefined values in the dataset. It iterates over each column and counts the occurrences of a specific value (assumed to be 99 in this case) that indicates an unknown or undefined value. This information can be crucial in understanding the quality and reliability of the data.

The code writes all the analysis results into the "data\_exploration.txt" file. The file includes information such as the data size, summary statistics for numerical variables, most common values for categorical variables, counts of missing values, and counts of unknown/undefined values. This file serves as a comprehensive report summarizing the findings of the data exploration analysis.

Overall, the code provides useful insights into the dataset's characteristics, which can inform further analysis and decision-making based on the data.

\subsection{Code Description}

The code performs an analysis on a dataset that includes diabetes related factors extracted from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for the year 2015. The dataset contains information on various health indicators such as diabetes status, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), and other demographic characteristics.

First, the code loads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. The dataset is a clean version of the original BRFSS dataset, with missing values removed.

Next, the code conducts descriptive statistics on physical activity, BMI, age, and sex stratified by diabetes incidence. The code groups the data by diabetes status and calculates the mean and standard deviation for each variable of interest. The results are stored in a DataFrame called "df0" and saved as a pickle file named "table\_0.pkl". This table provides an overview of the average physical activity, BMI, age, and sex for individuals with and without diabetes.

After preparing the dataset, the code performs an analysis using a multiple linear regression model to predict glycemic control among individuals with diabetes. The independent variables used in the model are physical activity, BMI, age, and sex. A constant term is added to the independent variables using the "sm.add\_constant()" function from the statsmodels library. The dependent variable is self-reported general health status. The code fits the regression model using the ordinary least squares (OLS) method provided by the statsmodels library.

The code generates a summary of the model using the "summary2()" function from the statsmodels library and extracts the table containing the model estimates. This table, which includes coefficients, standard errors, t-values, and p-values, is stored in a DataFrame called "df1". The DataFrame is then saved as a pickle file named "table\_1.pkl". This table provides insights into the relationship between physical activity, BMI, age, sex, and glycemic control among individuals with diabetes.

Finally, the code saves additional results in a pickle file named "additional\_results.pkl". These results include the total number of observations in the dataset and the R-squared value of the regression model. The R-squared value represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in the regression model.

In conclusion, the code performs data analysis to explore the relationship between various health indicators, demographic factors, and glycemic control among individuals with diabetes. The descriptive statistics and regression results provide valuable insights into the associations between these factors, which can inform future research, interventions, and public health initiatives related to diabetes management and prevention.
