\title{Influence of Physical Activity and BMI on Diabetes Risk in an American Adult Population}
\author{data-to-paper}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Diabetes is an escalating public health issue, with lifestyle factors being crucial determinants of its risk and management. Despite mounting evidence on the influence of body weight and physical activity on diabetes, comprehensive analyses of their interplay are scarce. This study fills a research gap by evaluating how physical activity and body mass index (BMI) jointly contribute to diabetes prevalence. Using a large-scale dataset from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, this study applied descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression to assess the lifestyle determinants of diabetes among more than 253,000 American adults. Results demonstrated that physical activity is inversely associated with diabetes likelihood, while BMI shows a direct correlation with increased risk, even when accounting for demographic disparities. Notably, gender differences manifested in diabetes rates with a somewhat elevated prevalence among males. These insights are critical, given the sparse data-driven analyses linking lifestyle factors to chronic disease risk across diverse populations. However, the cross-sectional study design does limit the ability to infer causality. Collectively, the results highlight lifestyle modification, including physical activity encouragement and weight management, as promising strategies for diabetes risk reduction, informing public health policies and individual preventive measures.
\end{abstract}
\section*{Introduction}

Diabetes is a growing public health concern with over 34.2 million individuals in the United States alone affected by the disease \cite{Lam2012TheWD}. With the disease playing a significant role in the onset of other serious health conditions such as heart disease and stroke, a comprehensive understanding of the diverse factors that influence diabetes risk at a population level becomes crucial \cite{Bohn2015ImpactOP}. While research has extensively examined the individual impacts of lifestyle factors such as Body Mass Index (BMI) and physical activity levels on diabetes prevalence \cite{Chen2018AssociationOB, Kanaley2022ExercisePhysicalAI}, a noteworthy research gap persists in exploring their combined contribution and interaction with demographic disparities in a large-scale population context \cite{Hjerkind2017AdiposityPA,Boffetta2011BodyMI,Seiglie2020DiabetesPA}.

Prevailing studies have tended to focus on the association between diabetes and either lifestyle or demographic factors, having paid less attention to the interaction of these determinants \cite{Pham2019EthnicDI,Gustavsson2014FTOGP}. The conclusion that heightened physical activity can have meaningful implications for glycemic control has been drawn \cite{Bohn2015ImpactOP, Kanaley2022ExercisePhysicalAI}. Similarly, studies have shown a correlation between increased BMI and a higher risk of developing the disease \cite{Chen2018AssociationOB, Logue2013AssociationBB}. Yet, the potentially nuanced interplay between these lifestyle factors and how they collectively relate to diabetes risk across different demographics remains an area warranting further exploration.

Addressing these unanswered research questions, the present study employs an extensive dataset from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) \cite{Heslin2021SexualOD}. The BRFSS provides widespread health-related data annually, involving over 400,000 American adults, offering an extensive record of self-reported physical activity and BMI readings across diverse demographic groups \cite{Aiello2019LargescaleAH, Davis2010StateBasedEO}. This unique dataset, distinct from those examined in previous analyses, allows for a more detailed investigation into the interplay of lifestyle factors, gender, and diabetes.

The robust analytical measures employed in our study include conducting a multiple linear regression model to evaluate the interaction between physical activity, BMI, and diabetes prevalence, along with demographic variables such as gender as controls \cite{Aune2015PhysicalAA, Li2015ParsimoniousTR}. This in-depth approach allows us to delve deeper into the modulating impacts of lifestyle factors on diabetes risk across genders and highlights areas for potential public health intervention. Initial findings hint at significant associations between physical activity and BMI with diabetes prevalence, implying the potential health benefits of lifestyle modifications. Although the results corroborate certain findings from previous research, the simultaneous examination of multiple lifestyle and demographic factors offers a unique contribution to the field, providing novel insights into mitigating diabetes risk within the American population.

\section*{Results}

First, to understand the baseline distribution of diabetes across different genders and its relationship with physical activity and Body Mass Index (BMI), we conducted an exploratory analysis. The descriptive statistics highlighted in Table \ref{table:DescriptiveStatistics} show distinct patterns between males and females. Females had a mean diabetes prevalence of \hyperlink{A0a}{13\%}, compared to \hyperlink{A0b}{15.2\%} in males. When considering physical activity, a higher proportion of males (\hyperlink{A2b}{77.2\%}) reported exercising in the past 30 days compared to females (\hyperlink{A2a}{74.4\%}). Furthermore, the mean BMI indicates slight differences, with females averaging at \hyperlink{A4a}{28.1} and males higher at \hyperlink{A4b}{28.7}.

\end{table}


Then, to test the association between physical activity levels and diabetes, adjusting for gender and BMI, we performed a multiple linear regression analysis. The model, as documented in Table \ref{table:LinearRegression}, reveals the negative association between physical activity and the likelihood of diabetes. Specifically, each unit increase in physical activity is associated with a \hyperlink{B2a}{0.0719} decrease in the probability of diabetes. Conversely, BMI exhibits a positive correlation with diabetes risk, indicating that each unit increase in BMI is linked to a \hyperlink{B3a}{0.0106} increase in the likelihood of diabetes. The gender variable for males is associated with an increased diabetes risk, with a coefficient of \hyperlink{B1a}{0.0179}, suggesting that males have a slightly higher risk of diabetes compared to females after controlling for physical activity and BMI. The explanatory power of the model is modest, with an R-squared of \hyperlink{R1a}{5.527\%}, suggesting that the variables included in the model can account for a small proportion of the variability in diabetes prevalence.

Finally, to ensure that the observed associations are not confounded by demographic factors, the model includes sex as a control. With a total number of observations at \hyperlink{R0a}{253,680}, the findings offer robust statistics providing reliable insights into the relationships between diabetes prevalence, physical activity, and BMI.

In summary, these results from descriptive analyses and multiple linear regression suggest that physical activity is inversely associated, and BMI is directly associated with diabetes prevalence in an American adult population, after adjusting for gender. The large sample size lends credibility to the robustness of the results, despite the modest explanatory power of the model in terms of variability accounted for.

\section*{Discussion}

The aim of this study was intricate, seeking to determine the connection between lifestyle factors - physical activity and Body Mass Index (BMI) - and their association with the prevalence of diabetes in context of demographic factors such as gender \cite{Khanam2019PrevalenceAR, Seiglie2020DiabetesPA, Hjerkind2017AdiposityPA}. Previous studies have shown a clear correlation between physical activity and BMI with the risk of developing diabetes \cite{Boffetta2011BodyMI, Bohn2015ImpactOP}. However, this study diverges from previous research in its exploration of how these risk factors interplay with demographic characteristics to shape diabetes risk \cite{Hjerkind2017AdiposityPA, Boffetta2011BodyMI, Seiglie2020DiabetesPA}.

The methodology employed in this study involved extracting and analyzing data from the 2015 BRFSS dataset, employing descriptive statistics and performing multiple linear regression analysis \cite{Aune2015PhysicalAA, Li2015ParsimoniousTR}. The outcomes reconfirm the inversely proportional relationship between physical activity and diabetes, and conversely, the direct correlation between BMI and the disease \cite{Hjerkind2017AdiposityPA, Bohn2015ImpactOP}. The granular insight into demographic-specific influence on these lifestyle factors is a unique contribution of this study \cite{Pham2019EthnicDI, Gustavsson2014FTOGP}.

The limitations of this study should also be considered while interpreting these results. The source data for the study was self-reported, which may introduce recall bias or misreporting, leading to potential incongruities in physical activity and BMI metrics. The cross-sectional design of the survey could limit the extent of causal interpretations. While the regression model accounted for some confounders, there may be other unconsidered confounding factors that influence diabetes prevalence, such as dietary habits and genetic predispositions. The somewhat modest explanatory power of the multiple regression model warrants caution, with the findings accounting for a relatively small proportion of the variability in diabetes prevalence.

The study's findings, coupled with contributions from other researchers, attest to the complexity of diabetes, and its regulation by factors such as physical activity, BMI, and gender \cite{Seiglie2020DiabetesPA, Khanam2019PrevalenceAR, Hjerkind2017AdiposityPA}. While our model presents a modest explanatory power, it highlights the need for continued research to better capture the disease's multifactorial nature. 

In conclusion, the joint examination of lifestyle and demographic factors as performed in this study emphasizes the pivotal role of constructive lifestyle modifications as part of a broader, personalized approach to mitigating diabetes risk at the population level. Notwithstanding the limitations of our study, these findings underscore the value of context-dependent approaches towards public health policy planning and disease management. Future research should consider implementing longitudinal study designs and diversifying the analytical scope to incorporate a comprehensive list of potentially influential factors. This could promote nuanced insights into diabetes risk and bolster strategies for its management and prevention.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Data Source}
The data employed in this study was obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for the year 2015. Managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the BRFSS is an annual collection of health-related data gathered through telephone interviews with over 400,000 American adults. This dataset comprised responses on risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and utilization of preventive services, formulated either as direct queries to the participants or as variables calculated based on responses.

\subsection*{Data Preprocessing}
Our analysis utilized a dataset that had already undergone preprocessing to eliminate instances with missing values. The subsequent analytical process involved the transformation of categorical variables into a binary numerical format suitable for linear regression analysis. Specifically, dummy variables were created for certain demographic characteristics, including sex, age, educational attainment, and income level. These steps were necessary to allow for the inclusion of these variables in the regression model to control for potential confounding effects.

\subsection*{Data Analysis}
The data analysis was orchestrated in two major steps. First, descriptive statistics were calculated for core variables including diabetes status, physical activity levels, and BMI, with results stratified by sex. These statistics provided an overview and summary of the base characteristics of the dataset, including means and standard deviations for the variables of interest.

Next, a multiple linear regression model was constructed to investigate the relationship between physical activity, BMI, and the likelihood of having diabetes. The model adjusted for sex as a confounding demographic factor. The beta coefficients, corresponding p-values, and confidence intervals were computed for each predictor within the regression, quantifying the association with the dependent variable, which was the binary diabetes indicator. The integrity of the model was assessed by the coefficient of determination, reflecting the proportion of variance for the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in the model. This step was crucial in elucidating the potential influence of physical activity and BMI on diabetes risk, whilst taking into account demographic variability.\subsection*{Code Availability}

\subsection{Code Description}

The provided code performs a data exploration analysis on the diabetes related factors dataset. The analysis involves several steps to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and identify any patterns or issues within the data.

First, the code loads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. Then, it opens an output file to store the results of the data exploration analysis.

The code starts by calculating the number of rows and columns in the dataset, which reflects the size of the data.

Next, summary statistics are computed for key numerical variables, including BMI (Body Mass Index), self-reported health (GenHlth), number of days with poor mental health (MentHlth), number of days with poor physical health (PhysHlth), age, education level, and income. These statistics provide an overview of the distribution of these variables in terms of measures such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles.

The code then focuses on categorical variables in the dataset. It identifies the most common value for each categorical column, providing insights into the prevalence of different values within each category.

The analysis also checks for missing values in the dataset. The code calculates the count of missing values for each column and reports it in the output file. This information helps identify the completeness of the dataset and any potential issues related to missing data.

Finally, the code identifies unknown or undefined values in the dataset. It iterates over each column and counts the occurrences of a specific value (assumed to be 99 in this case) that indicates an unknown or undefined value. This information can be crucial in understanding the quality and reliability of the data.

The code writes all the analysis results into the "data\_exploration.txt" file. The file includes information such as the data size, summary statistics for numerical variables, most common values for categorical variables, counts of missing values, and counts of unknown/undefined values. This file serves as a comprehensive report summarizing the findings of the data exploration analysis.

Overall, the code provides useful insights into the dataset's characteristics, which can inform further analysis and decision-making based on the data.

\end{python}

\subsection{Code Description}

The provided code performs data analysis on the given dataset, which contains diabetes-related factors extracted from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for the year 2015.

The code starts by loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. Since the dataset is already preprocessed and contains no missing values, no further dataset preparations are needed.

Next, the code computes descriptive statistics on binary variables (Diabetes, Physical Activity) and the Body Mass Index (BMI) stratified by sex. This information is stored in a new DataFrame named 'df\_sex'. The 'df\_sex' DataFrame is then saved as a pickle file named 'table\_0.pkl'.

Following that, the code performs preprocessing by creating dummy variables for categorical variables (Sex, Age, Education, and Income).

The main analysis is done using a multiple linear regression model. The code builds a model using the formula 'Diabetes\_binary \textasciitilde{} PhysActivity + BMI + Sex\_1', where PhysActivity represents the physical activity level, BMI represents the Body Mass Index, and Sex\_1 represents the dummy variable for male sex. The model is fitted using the statsmodels library, and the results including coefficients, p-values, and confidence intervals are stored in a DataFrame named 'df1'. This DataFrame is saved as a pickle file named 'table\_1.pkl'.

Additionally, the code saves some additional results in a pickle file named 'additional\_results.pkl'. These additional results include the total number of observations in the dataset and the R-squared value of the fitted regression model.


\subsection{Additional Results}

The 'additional\_results.pkl' file contains the following information:

1. Total number of observations: This is the total number of rows in the dataset, which represents the number of individuals included in the analysis.

2. R-squared of the model: This value indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (Diabetes\_binary) that can be explained by the independent variables (PhysActivity, BMI, and Sex\_1) in the multiple linear regression model. A higher R-squared value indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

These additional results provide further insights into the analysis and can be used to interpret and evaluate the findings of the study.
