Statistical Test: Perform a multiple linear regression with BMI as the independent variable, Diabetes_binary as the dependent variable, and include the interaction term between BMI and Smoker. Adjust for potential confounding variables such as age, sex, education, and income.

Hypothesis: 3. The association between BMI and the occurrence of Diabetes is moderated by consumption of fruits and vegetables
Statistical Test: Perform a multiple linear regression with BMI as the independent variable, Diabetes_binary as the dependent variable, and include the interaction terms between BMI and each of the variables Fruits and Veggies.
