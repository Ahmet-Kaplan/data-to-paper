Here is our Research Goal


Research Goal: 
To examine the relationship between different levels of physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, and the likelihood of diabetes among adults, while considering the potential moderating effect of BMI.

Hypothesis: 
Among adults with high BMI, those who engage in regular physical activity and consume a diet rich in fruits and vegetables will have a lower likelihood of diabetes compared to those with low levels of physical activity and poor dietary habits.
