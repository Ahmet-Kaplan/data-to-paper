    "```\nResearch Goal: \nTo investigate the association between physical activity and the likelihood of having high blood pressure, and whether this association is moderated by age.\n\nHypothesis: \nThere is a negative association between physical activity and the likelihood of having high blood pressure (Hypertension), and this association is moderated by age, such that the association is stronger among younger individuals compared to older individuals.\n```\n",
    "The research goal does not require any changes.",
    "(1) Bullet-point Review of Relevant Statistical Issues:\n\n- Multiple comparisons: This is not a concern for the specified hypotheses as we are testing a single association between physical activity and the likelihood of having high blood pressure, and its moderation by age.\n- Confounding variables: We can adjust for potential confounding variables such as gender, BMI, smoking status, and education level, which are available in the dataset.\n- Dependencies between data points: We need to consider the potential dependencies between data points as the dataset is derived from a survey where participants may come from the same household or community. We can account for potential clustering or dependence using appropriate statistical methods if necessary.\n- Missing data points: According to the data exploration output, there are no missing values in the dataset. Therefore, missing data is not a concern for our analysis.\n\n(2) Mapping of Hypotheses to Statistical Tests:\n\n{\n \"Association between physical activity and high blood pressure\":\n \"Logistic regression with physical activity as the independent variable and high blood pressure as the dependent variable while adjusting for potential confounding variables (gender, BMI, smoking status, education level).\",\n \n \"Moderation of the association between physical activity and high blood pressure by age\":\n \"Logistic regression with physical activity, age, and the interaction term between physical activity and age as explanatory variables, and high blood pressure as the dependent variable, while adjusting for potential confounding variables (gender, BMI, smoking status, education level).\"\n}"
