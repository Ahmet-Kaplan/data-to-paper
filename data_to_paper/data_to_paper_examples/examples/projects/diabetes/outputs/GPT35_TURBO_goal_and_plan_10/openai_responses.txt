    "Research Goal: \nTo investigate the relationship between physical activity and the risk of developing diabetes, considering the potential moderating effect of body mass index (BMI) and age.\n\nHypothesis: \nHigher levels of physical activity will be associated with a reduced risk of developing diabetes, especially among individuals with lower BMI and younger age.",
    "```\nResearch Goal: \nTo examine the association between fruit and vegetable consumption and the risk of high blood pressure, while considering the potential moderating effect of education level.\n\nHypothesis: \nHigher levels of fruit and vegetable consumption will be associated with a lower risk of high blood pressure, and this association will be stronger among individuals with higher education levels.\n```",
    "The research goal does not require any changes.",
    "(1) Relevant statistical issues:\n\n- Multiple comparisons: There is a potential for multiple comparisons as we are examining the association between fruit and vegetable consumption and high blood pressure while also considering the moderating effect of education level. We need to account for this issue to control the family-wise error rate.\n\n- Confounding variables: We should consider adjusting for confounding variables that may affect both fruit and vegetable consumption and high blood pressure. Some potential confounding variables available in the dataset are age and BMI.\n\n- Dependencies between data points: There may be dependencies between data points as the dataset represents a sample of individuals from the general population. We need to account for this dependence to avoid inflated significance levels and ensure valid inferences.\n\n- Missing data points: The data exploration indicates that there are no missing data points in the dataset. However, it is always good practice to verify this and handle any missing data appropriately if they are identified.\n\n(2) Statistical tests:\n\nHypothesis 1: Higher levels of fruit and vegetable consumption will be associated with a lower risk of high blood pressure, and this association will be stronger among individuals with higher education levels.\n\nStatistical test: Multiple linear regression\n\n- Perform a multiple linear regression with high blood pressure as the dependent variable and fruit and vegetable consumption as independent variables.\n- Adjust for potential confounding variables such as age and BMI in the regression model.\n- Include education level as an interaction term with fruit and vegetable consumption to test whether the association between fruit and vegetable consumption and high blood pressure varies by education level.\n\nHypothesis 2 (Additional hypothesis): Education level moderates the association between fruit and vegetable consumption and the risk of high blood pressure.\n\nStatistical test: Interaction analysis\n\n- Perform an interaction analysis between fruit and vegetable consumption and education level to evaluate whether the association between fruit and vegetable consumption and high blood pressure differs across levels of education.\n- This can be done using a multiple linear regression model with high blood pressure as the dependent variable, fruit and vegetable consumption and education level as independent variables, and including the interaction term between these two variables.\n- Adjust for potential confounding variables such as age and BMI in the regression model.\n\nPython dictionary mapping hypotheses to statistical tests:\n\n{\n \"Higher levels of fruit and vegetable consumption will be associated with a lower risk of high blood pressure, and this association will be stronger among individuals with higher education levels\":\n \"multiple linear regression with high blood pressure as the dependent variable, fruit and vegetable consumption and education level as independent variables, and including the interaction term between fruit and vegetable consumption and education level while adjusting for potential confounding variables such as age and BMI\",\n \"Education level moderates the association between fruit and vegetable consumption and the risk of high blood pressure\": \n \"interaction analysis between fruit and vegetable consumption and education level using a multiple linear regression model with high blood pressure as the dependent variable and including the interaction term while adjusting for potential confounding variables such as age and BMI\",\n}"
