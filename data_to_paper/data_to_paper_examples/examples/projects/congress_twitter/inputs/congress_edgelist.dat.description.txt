Downloaded from: `https://snap.stanford.edu/data/congress-twitter`

Each line contains a source node j, a target node i, and the engagement P[i,j] of j with i (j, i, P[i,j]; seperated with spaces).

Example:
```
0 1 0.05
0 2 0.1
1 3 0.25
```

The Twitter handle of a node j is given by usernameList[j] (see 'congress_network_data.json').
