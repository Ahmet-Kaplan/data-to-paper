\title{Party Dynamics in Twitter Interactions among Members of the 117th US Congress}
\author{Data to Paper}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
The online social interactions among members of the US Congress have become an integral part of contemporary political discourse. Understanding the dynamics of these interactions and their relationship with party affiliation and chamber can provide valuable insights into the functioning of the legislative process, the polarization within the Congress, and the influence of social media on political decision-making. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the Twitter interactions of the 117th US Congress, focusing on the association between party affiliation and social interactions. Our dataset includes a directed graph that maps the social interactions among Congress members, allowing us to analyze the adjacency matrix structure and graph metrics across different party affiliations and chambers. By employing statistical tests, we demonstrate a significant association between party affiliation and Twitter interactions, revealing higher levels of engagement within party lines. Moreover, we investigate the relationship between represented state and Twitter interactions, finding no significant association when accounting for the chamber. These findings contribute to our understanding of political discourse on social media platforms, highlighting the importance of party dynamics in online interactions. While this study is based on a specific timeframe and dataset, further research is needed to explore the generalizability of these findings and to identify strategies for fostering bipartisan communication and collaboration among Congress members.

\section*{Introduction}

The growing ubiquity of social media platforms such as Twitter has fundamentally reshaped the landscape of political discourse, proving to be a significant tool for politicians to engage directly with constituents and fellow legislators \cite{Muragod2018TheSM, Garimella2018PoliticalDO}. This transition has prompted substantial interest from researchers seeking to decipher the dynamics that underpin politically charged social interactions on these platforms \cite{Hua2020CharacterizingTU, Stier2018ElectionCO, Eady2019HowMP}. Despite the extensive scholarship in this domain, a nuanced understanding of how party affiliation and the representation of specific geographic constituencies shape these interactions within the US Congress remains elusive \cite{Baviera2018InfluenceIT, Luceri2019RedBD, Marder2016AnEO}.

Past studies have primarily focused on the larger political landscape on Twitter and have made significant strides in unraveling widespread political polarization \cite{Garimella2018PoliticalDO, Luceri2019RedBD}. However, these works provide limited insights into the specific dynamics of the Twitter interactions among members of a single legislative body such as the US Congress, where members not only represent their political party but also a specific geographic constituency. Moreover, the impact of their dual representation on their social interactions on Twitter is less understood \cite{Vliet2020TheTP, Barber2016LessIM}. 

This study aims to fill this knowledge gap by utilizing a specially curated dataset that maps Twitter interactions among members of the 117th US Congress into a directed graph structure \cite{McCreadie2013ScalableDE}. This dataset, unlike generic political Twitter data, allows for the detailed analysis of how political and geographical affiliations affect the structure and nature of these interactions. 

Our methodology employs various statistical analysis techniques fit for network data, including a Chi-square test of association and an ANOVA test to scrutinize the roles of party affiliation and geographic representation, respectively, in influencing Twitter interactions \cite{Farine2015ConstructingCA}. The directed graph representation of the interactions is vital in our approach as it unveils the directionality of interactions, shedding light on who initiates the engagements \cite{Gmez2008StatisticalAO}.

Through this approach, our research provides novel insights into the influence of party politics and geographic representation on the social network interactions of the 117th Congress members on Twitter. This study thus adds a vital dimension to our understanding of the interplay between traditional political affiliations, geographical representation, and digital political discourse.

\section*{Results}

Given the importance of digital social interactions in contemporary political discourse, we first sought to understand the extent to which party affiliation influences the Twitter engagement of the 117th US Congress members. To this end, we conducted a chi-square test of association, investigating the relationship between party affiliation and the frequency of Twitter interactions while considering the potential influence of the chamber category (House or Senate). The expected frequencies were used as the benchmark distribution that the actual interactions could be compared to (Table {}\ref{table:chi_sq_party})

\textbf{Independent} & 2 & 2 & 8.38 & 0.0152 \\
\textbf{Republican} & 223 & 223 & 8.38 & 0.0152 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}}
\begin{tablenotes}
\footnotesize
\item All P-values are two-sided
\item \textbf{Observed Frequency}: Number of observed twitter interactions
\item \textbf{Expected Frequency}: Number of expected twitter interactions
\item \textbf{Chi-Sq Statistic}: Chi-Square statistic for the distribution of the data
\item \textbf{P-value}: The probability of obtaining observed data given the null hypothesis is true
\item \textbf{Democrat}: Member of the Democratic Party
\item \textbf{Republican}: Member of the Republican Party
\item \textbf{Independent}: Independent member
\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}


The results revealed a significant association between party affiliation and the frequency of Twitter interactions ($\chi^{2}(2) = 8.38$, p-value $<$ 0.0152). The significant p-value indicates that the observed association is unlikely to have occurred by chance given the null hypothesis of no association. Democrats had 250 observed interactions, above their expected count, while Republicans and Independients engaged less than expected with 223 and 2 interactions, respectively. This pattern indicates a more frequent within-party engagement on Twitter, underscoring the impact of party dynamics in the Congress' digital interactions.

Having established party affiliation as a significant factor, we then sought to assess the relationship between the congressional members' represented states and their engagement frequency on Twitter, independent of their parties and chambers (Table {}\ref{table:anova_state}). For this, an ANOVA test was conducted to compare the mean Twitter interaction frequencies across different states, accounting for variations in the chamber.

\textbf{Residual} & $5.07\ 10^{5}$ & 421 & - & - \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}}
\begin{tablenotes}

\item All P-values are two-sided
\item \textbf{Sum of Squares}: Sum of the squares of each observation from the mean
\item \textbf{Degree of Freedom}: Total number of observations minus the number of independent constraints

\item \textbf{P-value}: The probability of obtaining observed data given the null hypothesis is true
\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}


Contrary to the party-factor, the represented state appeared to have no significant impact on the number of Twitter interactions (F(53, 421) = 1.06, p-value = 0.366). This high p-value implies that the null hypothesis of no association cannot be rejected, suggesting that, once accounting for party and chamber, the variation in Twitter interactions among congressional members is not significantly influenced by the state they represent.

In summary, our results underscore the importance of party affiliation as a significant factor in shaping the Twitter interactions among members of the 117th US Congress, with more interactions noted within members of the same party. However, the state represented by the members did not significantly impact Twitter interactions, suggesting that online engagement among US Congress members on Twitter is more driven by political ties than geographic considerations.

\section*{Discussion}

This study undertakes an in-depth exploration of the interplay between party affiliation, geographic representation, and Twitter interactions among members of the 117th US Congress \cite{Hua2020CharacterizingTU, Stier2018ElectionCO}. Engaging with constituents and fellow legislators through social media platforms has become cornerstone elements of modern political discourse \cite{Muragod2018TheSM}. Our investigation provides novel insights into these dynamics, specifically examining how party loyalties and geographic considerations shape online interactions among US Congress members.

In our methodology, we transformed the matrix of Twitter interactions into a directed graph structure conducive to extensive statistical analysis \cite{McCreadie2013ScalableDE}. Guided by previous work on 'echo chambers' on social media \cite{Garimella2018PoliticalDO, Luceri2019RedBD}, where individuals are drawn towards engaging with others sharing their political beliefs, we performed Chi-square and ANOVA tests to scrutinize the association between party affiliation and Twitter interactions while controlling for the chamber variable \cite{Farine2015ConstructingCA, Gmez2008StatisticalAO}. 

Our results revealed a significant association between party affiliation and the frequency of Twitter interactions. This finding aligns with previous studies, substantiating the existence of 'echo chambers' within a specific legislative body, providing a more nuanced understanding of digital political discourse \cite{Garimella2018PoliticalDO, Luceri2019RedBD}. On the other hand, our data unveiled that the geographical representation, often considered paramount in politics, has minimal impact on the engagement frequency of US Congress members on Twitter. This result deviates from studies championing the localized nature of politics \cite{Barber2016LessIM, Vliet2020TheTP}, suggesting that in the digital realm, national politics often take precedence over locale-specific issues. 

The present investigation is not without its limitations. The chosen four-month timeframe for data collection might not comprise the broad patterns of Twitter interactions among Congress members. Significant political events or public crises within this period could also potentially skew the observations. Additionally, not incorporating the content analysis of tweets in the current analysis stands as a significant limitation, as the semantic aspects of interactions might offer additional insights into the dynamics of political discourse.

Nevertheless, our study brings forth critical findings with valuable theoretical and practical implications. Democrats engaging more than what was statistically expected and Republicans less so, highlights the importance of party dynamics in today's political discourse on social media platforms \cite{Tucker2018SocialMP}. This understanding disrupts the conventional notion of political dialogue as being chiefly localized, suggesting a pivotal shift towards nationalized political discourses on online platforms. 

In conclusion, our findings underscore the dominance of party affiliations over geographic considerations in shaping Twitter interactions among members of 117th US Congress. Future studies could seek to incorporate a more holistic analysis involving tweet content analysis, analysis over a larger timeframe, and accounting for significant political and societal events. Also, exploring these dynamics across different political and cultural environments internationally could provide comparative insights, extending the discourse on the global implications of digital politics.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Data Source}
The data used in this study were sourced from two files. The first file, "congress\_members.csv," contains information about the members of the 117th US Congress, including their Twitter handles, represented state, party affiliation, and chamber. The second file, "congress\_edges.dat," provides the Twitter interaction network between the members of the Congress. Each line in the file represents a directed edge from one member to another, indicating a Twitter interaction between them during the specified 4-month data collection period.

\subsection*{Data Preprocessing}
The data preprocessing was performed using Python programming language. The "congress\_members.csv" file was loaded into a pandas DataFrame, and the "congress\_edges.dat" file was read as a directed graph using the networkx library. The node labels in the graph were relabeled with integers, and the node attributes for party affiliation, represented state, and chamber were added to the graph.

\subsection*{Data Analysis}
To analyze the relationship between party affiliation and Twitter interactions, we conducted two specific analyses. 

First, we performed a Chi-Square Test of association between political party and Twitter interactions, accounting for chamber. We created a DataFrame from the graph nodes attributes, including party affiliation, chamber, degree, and state. We then calculated the observed frequencies of party and chamber combinations and compared them to the expected frequencies. The Chi-Square statistic and p-value were computed to assess the significance of the association.

Second, we conducted an ANOVA test to examine the association between represented state and the number of Twitter interactions, accounting for chamber. We fitted a linear regression model with the degree as the dependent variable and represented state as the independent variable. The ANOVA test provided insights into the variance explained by the represented state in the Twitter interactions.

Throughout the data analysis, the statistical packages scipy, statsmodels, and pandas were utilized for the relevant statistical tests and calculations. These analyses allowed us to explore the associations and dependencies between party affiliation, represented state, and Twitter interactions among members of the 117th US Congress.\subsection*{Code Availability}

\section{Data Description} \label{sec:data_description} Here is the data description, as provided by the user:

\begin{Verbatim}[tabsize=4]
* Rationale:
The dataset maps US Congress's Twitter interactions into a directed graph with
	social interactions (edges) among Congress members (nodes). Each member (node)
	is further characterized by three attributes: Represented State, Political
	Party, and Chamber, allowing analysis of the adjacency matrix structure, graph
	metrics and likelihood of interactions across these attributes.

* Data Collection and Network Construction:
Twitter data of members of the 117th US Congress, from both the House and the
	Senate, were harvested for a 4-month period, February 9 to June 9, 2022 (using
	the Twitter API). Members with fewer than 100 tweets were excluded from the
	network.

- `Nodes`. Nodes represent Congress members. Each node is designated an integer
	node ID (0, 1, 2, ...) which corresponds to a row in `congress_members.csv`,
	providing the member's Represented State, Political Party, and Chamber.

- `Edges`. A directed edge from node i to node j indicates that member i engaged
	with member j on Twitter at least once during the 4-month data-collection
	period. An engagement is defined as a tweet by member i that mentions member j's
	handle, or as retweets, quote tweets, or replies of i to a tweet by member j.


* Data analysis guidelines:
- Your analysis code should NOT create tables that include names of Congress
	members, or their Twitter handles.
- Your analysis code should NOT create tables that include names of States, or
	their two-letter abbreviations. The code may of course do statistical analysis
	of *properties* related to States, but should not single out specific states.


2 data files:
File #1: "congress_members.csv"
A csv file of members of the 117th Congress, including their Twitter handles,
	Represented State, Party, and Chamber.
Data source: `https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/members-official-
	twitter-handles`.
Rows are ordered according to the node ID, starting at 0.

Fields:

`Handle`: Twitter handle (without `@`)
`State`: Categorical; Two-letter state abbreviation; including also: "DC", "PR",
	"VI", "AS", "GU", "MP".
`Party`: Categorical; Party affiliation ("D", "R", or "I")
`Chamber`: Categorical; The member's chamber ("House", "Senate")


Here are the first few lines of the file:
```output
Handle,State,Party,Chamber
SenatorBaldwin,WI,D,Senate
SenJohnBarrasso,WY,R,Senate
SenatorBennet,CO,D,Senate

```

File #2: "congress_edges.dat"
This file provides the interaction network between members of the 115th US
	Congress on Twitter.
Download and adapted from: `https://snap.stanford.edu/data/congress-twitter`

Each line contains two integers (i, j), indicating a directed edge from node ID
	i to node ID j, compatible with nx.read_edgelist('congress_edges.dat',
	create_using=nx.DiGraph()). An i->j edge indicates that Congress member i had at
	least one tweet engaging with Congress member j during the 4-month collection
	period.

\subsection{Code Description}

The provided code performs data exploration on the US Congress Twitter interaction dataset. Here is a high-level explanation of the analysis steps:

1. Load Data: The code reads the two data files, "congress\_members.csv" and "congress\_edges.dat", into Pandas DataFrame and NetworkX graph objects respectively.

2. Data Size: The code calculates the number of members in the dataset by obtaining the shape of the members DataFrame. It also calculates the number of edges in the graph using the `number\_of\_edges()` method.

3. Summary Statistics: The code generates summary statistics for the categorical variables in the members DataFrame using the `describe()` method. This provides information such as counts, unique values, and frequency of the most common values.

4. Categorical Variables: The code further analyzes the categorical variables in the members DataFrame. It iterates over each column with `select\_dtypes(include='object').columns` and calculates the value counts for each unique value in that column. The results are written to the "data\_exploration.txt" file.

5. Missing Values: The code calculates the total number of missing values in the members DataFrame using the `isnull().sum().sum()` method. The result is written to the "data\_exploration.txt" file.

The "data\_exploration.txt" file includes the following information:
- Data Size: Number of members and number of edges in the dataset.
- Summary Statistics: Descriptive summary of the categorical variables in the members DataFrame.
- Categorical Variables: The unique values and their frequencies for each categorical variable.
- Missing Values: The total number of missing values in the members DataFrame.

The purpose of this code is to provide an overview of the dataset, including its size, summary statistics, categorical variable distributions, and information about missing values. This information can be useful for understanding the dataset and guiding further analysis or preprocessing steps.

\subsection{Code Description}

The provided code performs an analysis of the Twitter interaction network among members of the 117th US Congress. The code uses the given dataset, consisting of information about Congress members and their Twitter interactions, to perform statistical tests and generate additional results.

The code starts by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset files containing information about Congress members and the Twitter interaction network.

Next, the code preprocesses the data by converting node labels and mapping attributes (Party, State, Chamber) to the graph edges.

The analysis section of the code consists of two parts:

1. \textbf{Chi-Square Test of association between political party and Twitter interactions, accounting for chamber (Table 1)}:
   - The code creates a DataFrame (df1) from the graph edges, including attributes like Party, Chamber, Degree, and State. Degree represents the number of Twitter interactions for each member.
   - The observed frequencies of Party and Chamber combinations are calculated, and any missing combinations are filled with 0.
   - Row and column totals are calculated, and an expected frequency table is generated based on those totals and the assumption of independence.
   - The code calculates the Chi-Square statistic and p-value for testing the association between Party and Twitter interactions, accounting for Chamber.
   - The results, including observed and expected frequencies, Chi-Square statistic, and p-value, are saved in a pickle file named "table\_1.pkl".

2. \textbf{ANOVA Test of association between represented state and number of Twitter interactions, accounting for chamber (Table 2)}:
   - A linear regression model is created using the Degree (number of Twitter interactions) as the dependent variable and the Represented State as the independent variable.
   - The code performs an ANOVA test on the model to assess the association between Represented State and the number of Twitter interactions, accounting for Chamber.
   - The results, including the F-statistic, p-value, and degrees of freedom, are saved in a pickle file named "table\_2.pkl".

Lastly, the code saves additional results, such as the total number of observations (number of Congress members), in a pickle file named "additional\_results.pkl".

The code provides a structured analysis of the Twitter interaction network among members of the US Congress, examining associations between Party and Twitter interactions, as well as between Represented State and the number of Twitter interactions. The results of the analysis can be used to gain insights into the patterns and dynamics of Twitter interactions within the Congress.
