Description of the Dataset:

* Rationale:
The dataset maps US Congress's Twitter interactions into a directed graph with social interactions (edges) among Congress members (nodes). Each member
(node) is further characterized by three attributes: Represented State, Political Party, and Chamber, allowing analysis of the adjacency matrix
structure, graph metrics and likelihood of interactions across these attributes.

* Data Collection and Network Construction:
Twitter data of members of the 117th US Congress, from both the House and the Senate, were harvested for a 4-month period, February 9 to June 9, 2022
(using the Twitter API). Members with fewer than 100 tweets were excluded from the network.

- `Nodes`. Nodes represent Congress members. Each node is designated an integer node ID (0, 1, 2, ...) which corresponds to a row in
`congress_members.csv`, providing the member's Represented State, Political Party, and Chamber.

- `Edges`. A directed edge from node i to node j indicates that member i engaged with member j on Twitter at least once during the 4-month data-
collection period. An engagement is defined as a tweet by member i that mentions member j's handle, or as retweets, quote tweets, or replies of i to a
tweet by member j.


* Data analysis guidelines:
- Your analysis code should NOT create tables that include names of Congress members, or their Twitter handles.
- Your analysis code should NOT create tables that include names of States, or their two-letter abbreviations. The code may of course do statistical
analysis of *properties* related to States, but should not single out specific states.


2 data files:
File #1: "congress_members.csv"
A csv file of members of the 117th Congress, including their Twitter handles, Represented State, Party, and Chamber.
Data source: `https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/members-official-twitter-handles`.
Rows are ordered according to the node ID, starting at 0.

Fields:

`Handle`: Twitter handle (without `@`)
`State`: Categorical; Two-letter state abbreviation; including also: "DC", "PR", "VI", "AS", "GU", "MP".
`Party`: Categorical; Party affiliation ("D", "R", or "I")
`Chamber`: Categorical; The member's chamber ("House", "Senate")


Here are the first few lines of the file:
```output
Handle,State,Party,Chamber
SenatorBaldwin,WI,D,Senate
SenJohnBarrasso,WY,R,Senate
SenatorBennet,CO,D,Senate

```

File #2: "congress_edges.dat"
This file provides the interaction network between members of the 115th US Congress on Twitter.
Download and adapted from: `https://snap.stanford.edu/data/congress-twitter`

Each line contains two integers (i, j), indicating a directed edge from node ID i to node ID j, compatible with nx.read_edgelist('congress_edges.dat',
create_using=nx.DiGraph()). An i->j edge indicates that Congress member i had at least one tweet engaging with Congress member j during the 4-month
collection period.

[5] ----- USER {DataExplorer} -> data_exploration_code -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As part of a data-exploration phase, please write a complete short Python code for getting a first sense of the data.

Your code should create an output text file named "data_exploration.txt", which should contain a summary of the data.

The output file should be self-contained; any results you choose to save to this file should be accompanied with a short header.

The output file should be formatted as follows:

```output
# Data Size
<Measure of the scale of our data (e.g., number of rows, number of columns)>

# Summary Statistics
<Summary statistics of all or key variables>

# Categorical Variables
<As applicable, list here categorical values and their most common values>

# Missing Values
<Counts of missing, unknown, or undefined values>
<As applicable, counts of special numeric values that stand for unknown/undefined if any (check in the "Description of the Dataset" above for any)>

# <title of other summary you deem relevant, if any>
<Add any other summary of the data you deem relevant>

# <etc for any other summary you deem relevant.>
```

If any of the above sections is not applicable, then write "Not Applicable" under that section.

If needed, you can use the following packages which are already installed:
('pandas', 'numpy', 'scipy')

Do not provide a sketch or pseudocode; write a complete runnable code.
Do not create any graphics, figures or any plots.
Do not send any presumed output examples.

This script will load the data, and then write different sections to the requested output file. Each section includes an appropriate header, and the
information is printed in a readable format.

The first section reports the number of nodes and edges in the graph. In the "Summary Statistics" section, the `describe()` function is used to give a
comprehensive summary of each DataFrame.

In the "Categorical Variables" section, the `value_counts()` function is used to count the number of occurrences of each unique value in the
corresponding column. Lastly, the "Missing Values" section computes the total number of missing values in each column of the DataFrame. This is done
with the `isna().sum()` function, which first creates a boolean mask of the DataFrame indicating the missing values and then sums over it.

Please follow these two steps:

(1) Check the code and the output for any issues, and return a bullet-point response addressing these points:
* Are there any unexpected NaN values in the output.
* Can results be understood from the output file? In particular, do we have a short label for each result?
* Are there any results that are missing. Check that under each header in the output file there is a corresponding meaningful result (or "Not
Applicable" if not applicable).
* Any other issues you find.

(2) Based on your assessment above, return a Python Dict[str, str] mapping the issues you have noted above (dict keys) to specific suggested
corrections/improvements in the code (dict values).

For example:

{
    "The result of the average of variable ... is missing":     "Add the missing calculation of ... to the code.",
    "The average of the variable <xxx> is `Nan`":     "Remove missing values in the calculation."
}


Try to be as specific as possible when describing the issues and proposed fixes.
Include in the dict as many issues as you find.
If there are no issues, and the code and tables are just perfect and need no corrections or enhancements, then return an empty dict:

{}


Important:
* Do not return the revised code, only the issues and suggested fixes.
* If there are no critical issues, then return an empty dict: `{}`.
* Do not create positive issues that require no change in the code. In particular, do not write {"No issues found": "No corrections or improvements
are needed."}, return an empty dict instead.

DESCRIPTION OF THE ORIGINAL DATASET

* Rationale:
The dataset maps US Congress's Twitter interactions into a directed graph with social interactions (edges) among Congress members (nodes). Each member
(node) is further characterized by three attributes: Represented State, Political Party, and Chamber, allowing analysis of the adjacency matrix
structure, graph metrics and likelihood of interactions across these attributes.

* Data Collection and Network Construction:
Twitter data of members of the 117th US Congress, from both the House and the Senate, were harvested for a 4-month period, February 9 to June 9, 2022
(using the Twitter API). Members with fewer than 100 tweets were excluded from the network.

- `Nodes`. Nodes represent Congress members. Each node is designated an integer node ID (0, 1, 2, ...) which corresponds to a row in
`congress_members.csv`, providing the member's Represented State, Political Party, and Chamber.

- `Edges`. A directed edge from node i to node j indicates that member i engaged with member j on Twitter at least once during the 4-month data-
collection period. An engagement is defined as a tweet by member i that mentions member j's handle, or as retweets, quote tweets, or replies of i to a
tweet by member j.


* Data analysis guidelines:
- Your analysis code should NOT create tables that include names of Congress members, or their Twitter handles.
- Your analysis code should NOT create tables that include names of States, or their two-letter abbreviations. The code may of course do statistical
analysis of *properties* related to States, but should not single out specific states.


2 data files:

Rows are ordered according to the node ID, starting at 0.

Fields:

`Handle`: Twitter handle (without `@`)
`State`: Categorical; Two-letter state abbreviation; including also: "DC", "PR", "VI", "AS", "GU", "MP".
`Party`: Categorical; Party affiliation ("D", "R", or "I")
`Chamber`: Categorical; The member's chamber ("House", "Senate")


Here are the first few lines of the file:

\section{Code Explanation}

The purpose of the code is to perform data exploration on the provided dataset of US Congress Twitter interactions.

First, the code loads the dataset by reading the "congress_members.csv" file, which contains information about the Congress members, such as their
Twitter handles, represented states, party affiliations, and chambers. It also reads the "congress_edges.dat" file, which represents the interaction
network between Congress members on Twitter.

The code then proceeds to perform several analysis steps and write the results into the "data_exploration.txt" file.

1. Data Size:
   - The code calculates and writes the number of nodes (Congress members) and the number of edges (interactions) in the dataset.

2. Summary Statistics:
   - For the members file, the code computes and writes the descriptive statistics for all columns, including measures such as count, unique values,
top value, and frequency.
   - For the edges file, the code calculates and writes the number of interactions per node, including the minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation,
and quartile values.

3. Categorical Variables:
   - For each of the categorical variables (State, Party, Chamber) in the members file, the code determines the most common values and writes them
into the file.

   - The code checks for missing values in the members file and writes the count of missing values for each column.

The output of the code is a text file, "data_exploration.txt", which contains the results of the data exploration analysis. This file provides
essential information and summary statistics about the dataset, allowing researchers to gain insights into the characteristics of the Congress Twitter
interactions and make informed decisions for further analysis.

[6] COMMENTER -> research_goal <after_background>  : Background messages completed. Requesting "research goal and hypothesis".

[7] ----- USER {GoalReviewer} -> research_goal -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please suggest a research goal and an hypothesis that can be studied using only the provided dataset.
The goal and hypothesis should be interesting and novel.

Guidelines:

* Try to avoid trivial hypotheses (like just testing for simple linear associations).
Instead, you could perhaps explore more complex associations and relationships, like testing for moderation effects or interactions between variables.

* Do not limit yourself to the provided data structure and variables; you can create new variables from the existing ones, and use them in your
hypotheses.

* Make sure that your suggested hypothesis can be studied using only the provided dataset, without requiring any additional data. In particular, pay
attention to using only data available based on the provided headers of our data files (see "{data_file_descriptions}", above).

* Avoid choosing politically sided goals. For example, do NOT choose a goal like "Democrats are more/less engaged than Republicans"

* Avoid choosing the following 4 goals that we have already explored:
(1)
Research Goal:
To examine the role of chamber (House or Senate) in shaping the interaction network within the 117th US Congress.

Hypothesis:
Members of the House of Representatives will have more interactions amongst themselves in the Twitter network, compared to the members of the Senate.
This could potentially be due to the larger number of members in the House, which might result in a denser network of interactions amongst them.

(2)
Research Goal:
To explore the potential correlations and dependencies between political party affiliation and the structure of the Twitter interaction network
amongst the members of the 117th US Congress.

Hypothesis:
The pattern of Twitter interactions between members of the U.S. Congress significantly differs based on political party affiliation. Specifically,
members are likely to engage more with members of the same political party, but there will also be considerable inter-party interactions,
demonstrating that Twitter discourse in the Congress transcends partisan lines to a certain extent.

(3)
Research Goal:
To analyze the role of regional representation in shaping the retweet network within the 117th US Congress on Twitter.

Hypothesis:
Twitter interactions in the form of retweets between members of the U.S. Congress will be more frequent between representatives of states with similar
political profiles. For example, states with the same dominant political party might have a higher frequency of retweet interactions, suggesting
shared political interests and viewpoints.

(4)
Research Goal:
To examine the influence of state representation size on the volume of Twitter interactions among members of the 117th US Congress.

Hypothesis:
Congress members representing states with a larger number of representatives (indicative of larger population sizes) will have a higher volume of
Twitter interactions compared to those from states with fewer representatives. This may be due to increased constituent engagement and a larger scope
for public political discussion.

* Do not suggest methodology. Just the goal and an hypothesis.

While the research goal and hypothesis are interesting, there are a few potential issues:

* The hypothesis might not be testable with the given dataset since the dataset does not directly provide information about the length of service of
each Congress member.
    - Suggestion: An alternative hypothesis could be "Members of Congress who are more active on Twitter (as indicated by frequency of posts) have
more interactions (as evidenced by the number of edges in the network graph).

* The hypothesis is tied to a variable (length of service of a Congress member) that is not present in the dataset, which might make the result
irrelevant to the present study.
    - Suggestion: You may revise the hypothesis to only involve variables listed in the dataset, perhaps focusing on the differential interaction
patterns between the House and Senate, or differences in interactions based on Party affiliation.

* The hypothesis is slightly broad, considering the diversity of Congress members' factors influencing Twitter dealings.
    - Suggestion: Consider focusing on a single attribute like 'Chamber' or 'Party' to examine the nature of Twitter interactions among members in
these categories.

In conclusion, it's crucial to ensure the hypothesis is testable given the provided dataset and is interesting, novel, and well-focused.

Please write literature-search queries that we can use to search for papers related to our study.

You would need to compose search queries to identify prior papers covering these 2 areas:
"dataset": papers that use the same or similar datasets as in our study
"questions": papers that ask questions similar to our study

Return your answer as a `Dict[str, List[str]]`, where the keys are the 2 areas noted above, and the values are lists of query string. Each individual
query should be a string with up to 5-10 words.

For example, for a study reporting waning of the efficacy of the covid-19 BNT162b2 vaccine based on analysis of the "United Kingdom National Core Data
(UK-NCD)", the queries could be:

{
    "dataset": ['The UK-NCD dataset', 'covid-19 vaccine efficacy dataset']

OVERALL DESCRIPTION OF THE DATASET

* Rationale:
The dataset maps US Congress's Twitter interactions into a directed graph with social interactions (edges) among Congress members (nodes). Each member
(node) is further characterized by three attributes: Represented State, Political Party, and Chamber, allowing analysis of the adjacency matrix
structure, graph metrics and likelihood of interactions across these attributes.

* Data Collection and Network Construction:
Twitter data of members of the 117th US Congress, from both the House and the Senate, were harvested for a 4-month period, February 9 to June 9, 2022
(using the Twitter API). Members with fewer than 100 tweets were excluded from the network.

- `Nodes`. Nodes represent Congress members. Each node is designated an integer node ID (0, 1, 2, ...) which corresponds to a row in
`congress_members.csv`, providing the member's Represented State, Political Party, and Chamber.

- `Edges`. A directed edge from node i to node j indicates that member i engaged with member j on Twitter at least once during the 4-month data-
collection period. An engagement is defined as a tweet by member i that mentions member j's handle, or as retweets, quote tweets, or replies of i to a
tweet by member j.


* Data analysis guidelines:
- Your analysis code should NOT create tables that include names of Congress members, or their Twitter handles.
- Your analysis code should NOT create tables that include names of States, or their two-letter abbreviations. The code may of course do statistical
analysis of *properties* related to States, but should not single out specific states.

(1) Similarities Between Our Goal & Hypothesis and Related Papers:

- All studies, including ours, focus on studying the patterns of interactions on Twitter especially as it relates to political entities.
- They all use data-driven approaches to analyze the factors influencing the Twitter engagements and interactions of political entities.
- The papers such as by Hua2020TowardsMA, Badawy2018WhoFF, and Beers2023FollowbackCS also explore aspects related to the influence of location and
political ideology, similar to our hypothesis focusing on the influence of Congress member's local representation.

(2) Distinctiveness of Our Stated Goal & Hypothesis:

- Despite the similarities, our research specifically focuses on the interaction patterns within the 117th US Congress, which is neither explicitly
nor specifically covered in the related papers.
- Unlike others, our study probes into the influence of local representation (i.e., number of representatives per state) on the engagement level of
Congress members, adding a new dimension to the existing body of knowledge.

(3) Assessment of Novelty:

Considering the above arguments, I would say:

{'choice': 'OK'}

While there are certain commonalities like the data-driven exploration of Twitter interactions of political personas, the specific focus on the impact
of local representation within the 117th US Congress provides uniqueness to our research goal and hypothesis. Hence, our study offers significant
novelty compared to the existing literature and could potentially lead to interesting and novel findings.

We would like to test the specified hypotheses using the provided dataset.

Please follow these two steps:

(1) Return a bullet-point review of relevant statistical issues.
Read the "{data_file_descriptions}" and the "Data Exploration Code and Output" provided above, and then for each of the following generic statistical
issues determine if they are relevant for our case and whether they should be accounted for:
* multiple comparisons.
* confounding variables (see available variables in the dataset that we can adjust for).
* dependencies between data points.
* missing data points.
* any other relevant statistical issues.

(2) Create a Python Dict[str, str], mapping each hypothesis (dict key) to the statistical test that would be most adequate for testing it (dict
value).
The keys of this dictionary should briefly describe each of our hypotheses.
The values of this dictionary should specify the most adequate statistical test for each hypothesis, and describe how it should be performed while
accounting for any issues you have outlined above as relevant.

For each of our hypotheses, suggest a *single* statistical test.
If there are several possible ways to test a given hypothesis, specify only *one* statistical test (the simplest one).

Your response for this part should be formatted as a Python dictionary, like this:

{
    "xxx is associated with yyy and zzz":
        "linear regression with xxx as the independent variable and yyy and zzz as the dependent variables while adjusting for aaa, bbb, ccc",
    "the association between xxx and yyy is moderated by zzz": 
        "repeat the above linear regression, while adding the interaction term between yyy and zzz",
}


These of course are just examples. Your actual response should be based on the goal and hypotheses that we have specified above (see the "Research
Goal" above).

Note how in the example shown the different hypotheses are connected to each other, building towards a single
study goal.

Remember to return a valid Python dictionary Dict[str, str].

(1) Review of Relevant Statistical Issues:

- Multiple comparisons: Since we have formulated a single hypothesis, multiple comparisons are not an issue in this case.

- Confounding variables: It is important to account for potential confounding variables that may influence the relationship between a Congress
member's local representation and their engagement level. In our dataset, the available variables that can be adjusted for are State, Party, and
Chamber.

- Dependencies between data points: We need to consider the potential dependencies between data points since the interaction network is constructed
based on Twitter engagement. The tweets and interactions between Congress members may be influenced by the overall structure of the network.

- Missing data points: The provided dataset does not have missing values, so missing data is not an issue in this case.

- Other relevant statistical issues: It is important to consider the potential bias introduced by the data collection method (using the Twitter API).
The patterns of engagement on Twitter may not fully represent the overall engagement levels and interactions of Congress members.

(2) Mapping of Hypotheses to Statistical Tests:

{
 "Members from states with a higher number of representatives engage in a greater number of Twitter interactions":
 "ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the mean/median number of interactions across different states, adjusting for confounding variables such as
Party and Chamber.",

 "The relationship between the number of representatives of a state and the number of Twitter interactions is moderated by political party":
 "Multiple regression analysis with the number of interactions as the dependent variable, the number of representatives and political party as
independent variables, while controlling for Chamber.",

 "Congress members from larger states with more representatives have a higher level of engagement diversity (measured by the number of unique
interactions) compared to smaller states":
 "ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the mean/median number of unique interactions across different states, adjusting for confounding variables
such as Party and Chamber.",

 "The association between the number of representatives and the level of engagement diversity is different for House members compared to Senate
members":
 "Multiple regression analysis with the number of unique interactions as the dependent variable, the number of representatives and chamber as
independent variables, while controlling for Party.",

 "The relationship between state population size and engagement level on Twitter follows a linear or non-linear pattern":
 "Pearson's correlation or Spearman's correlation to examine the association between State population size and the number of Twitter interactions,
adjusting for confounding variables such as Party and Chamber."

[10] COMMENTER -> data_analysis_code <after_background>  : Background messages completed. Requesting "Data Analysis code".

[11] ---- USER {Debugger} -> data_analysis_code ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a complete Python code to analyze the data and create dataframes as basis for scientific Tables for our paper.

The code must have the following sections (with these exact capitalized headers):

`# IMPORT`
`import pickle`
You can also import here any other packages you need from:
('pandas', 'numpy', 'scipy', 'statsmodels', 'sklearn', 'pickle')


`# LOAD DATA`
Load the data from the original data files described above (see "Description of the Original Dataset").


`# DATASET PREPARATIONS`
* Join data files as needed.
* Dealing with missing, unknown, or undefined values, or with special numeric values that stand for unknown/undefined (check in the "Description of
the Original Dataset" for any such values, and consider also the "Output of the Data Exploration Code").
* Create new variables as needed.
* Restrict the data based on exclusion/inclusion criteria (to match study goal, if applicable).
* Standardize numeric values with different units into same-unit values.

If no dataset preparations are needed, write below this header: `# No dataset preparations are needed.`


`# DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS`
* In light of our study goals and the hypothesis testing plan (see above "Research Goal" and "Hypothesis Testing Plan"), decide whether and which
descriptive statistics are needed to be included in the research paper and create a relevant table.

For example:
`## Table 0: "Descriptive statistics of height and age stratified by sex"`
Write here the code to create a descriptive statistics dataframe `df0` and save it using:
`df0.to_pickle('table_0.pkl')`

If no descriptive statistics are needed, write: `# No descriptive statistics table is needed.`


`# PREPROCESSING`
Perform any preprocessing steps needed to prepare the data for the analysis.
For example, as applicable:
* Creating dummy variables for categorical variables.
* Any other data preprocessing you deem relevant.

If no preprocessing is needed, write: `# No preprocessing is needed, because <your reasons here>.`


`# ANALYSIS`
Considering our "Research Goal" and "Hypothesis Testing Plan", decide on 1-3 tables (in addition to the above descriptive statistics, if any) we
should create for our scientific paper. Typically, we should have at least one table for each hypothesis test.

For each such scientific table:
[a] Write a comment with a suggested table's caption.
Choose a caption that clearly describes the table's content and its purpose.
For example:
`## Table 1: "Test of association between age and risk of death, accounting for sex and race"`
Avoid generic captions such as `## Table 1: "Results of analysis"`.

[b] Perform analysis
- Perform appropriate analysis and/or statistical tests (see above our "Hypothesis Testing Plan").
- Account for relevant confounding variables, as applicable.
- Note that you may need to perform more than one test for each hypothesis.
- Try using inherent functionality and syntax provided in functions from the available Python packages (above). Avoid, as possible, manually
implementing generically available functionality.
For example, to include interactions in regression analysis (if applicable), use the `formula = "y ~ a * b"` syntax in statsmodels formulas, rather
than trying to manually multiply the variables.

[c] Create and save a dataframe representing the scientific table (`df1`, `df2`, etc):
* Only include information that is relevant and suitable for inclusion in a scientific table.
* Nominal values should be accompanied by a measure of uncertainty (CI or STD and p-value).
* Exclude data not important to the research goal, or that are too technical.
* Do not repeat the same data in multiple tables.
* The table should have labels for both the columns and the index (rows):
    - As possible, do not invent new names; just keep the original variable names from the dataset.
    - As applicable, also keep any attr names from statistical test results.


Overall, the section should have the following structure:

`# ANALYSIS`
`## Table 1: <your chosen table name here>`
Write here the code to analyze the data and create a dataframe df1 for the table 1
`df1.to_pickle('table_1.pkl')`

`## Table 2: <your chosen table name here>`
etc, up to 3 tables.


# SAVE ADDITIONAL RESULTS
At the end of the code, after completing the tables, create a dict containing any additional results you deem important to include in the scientific
paper, and save it to a pkl file 'additional_results.pkl'.

For example:

`additional_results = {
    'Total number of observations': <xxx>,
    'accuracy of <mode name> model': <xxx>,
    # etc, any other results and important parameters that are not included in the tables
}
with open('additional_results.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(additional_results, f)
`

Avoid the following:
Do not provide a sketch or pseudocode; write a complete runnable code including all '# HEADERS' sections.
Do not create any graphics, figures or any plots.
Do not send any presumed output examples.
Avoid convoluted or indirect methods of data extraction and manipulation; For clarity, use direct attribute access for clarity and simplicity.
For clarity, access dataframes using string-based column/index names, rather than integer-based column/index positions.

Given the prompt, it seems like the issue is due to multi-collinearity, or the presence of predictor variables that are correlated with each other.
Due to the interaction term in the formula, certain attributes could be highly correlated. In this scenario, we consider dropping the interaction term
between the categorical predictors. Here's the revised code:


# FULL CODE SENT BY CHATGPT IS SHOWN AS A DIFF WITH PREVIOUS CODE
-model = smf.ols(formula = "Interactions ~ State_Representatives * C(Party) * C(Chamber)", data = members)
+
+# Remove interaction term due to multicollinearity
+model = smf.ols(formula = "Interactions ~ State_Representatives + C(Party) + C(Chamber)", data = members)
This code is adjusted by removing the interaction term between `Party` and `Chamber` in our regression formula to reduce multicollinearity.

Labeling row with sequential numbers is not common in scientific tables.
Though, if you are sure that starting each row with a sequential number is really what you want, then convert it from int to strings, so that it is
clear that it is not a mistake.


Please rewrite the complete code again with these issues corrected.

GENERAL FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
Even if you are changing just a few lines, you must return the complete code again in a single code block, including the unchanged parts, so that I
can just copy-paste and run it.

The code runs ok, but I am worried that it may contain some fundamental mathematical or statistical flaws. To check for such flaws, I will need you to
carefully follow these two steps:

(1) Deeply check your Python code for any fundamental coding/mathematical/statistical flaws and return a bullet-point response addressing these points
(as applicable):

* WRONG FORMULA:
- List all key mathematical formulas used in the code and indicate for each one if it is correct, or if it should be revised.

* TRIVIALLY-TRUE STATISTICAL TESTS:
Are there any statistical tests that are mathematically trivial? Like:
- testing whether the mean of all values above 0 is above 0.
- comparing distributions that have different underlying scales (or different ranges), and which were not properly normalized.
- testing whether the mean of X + Y is larger than the mean of X, when Y is positive.
- etc, any other tests that you suspect are trivial.

* OTHER:
Any other mathematical or statistical issues that you can identify.

(2) Based on your assessment above, return a Python Dict[str, str] mapping the issues you have noted
above (dict keys) to specific suggested corrections/improvements in the code (dict values).

For example:

{
    "The formula for the regression model is incorrect":     "revise the code to use the following formula: ...",
    "The statistical test for association of ... and ... is trivial":     "revise the code to perform the following more meaningful test: ...",
}


Try to be as specific as possible when describing the issues and proposed fixes.
Include in the dict as many issues as you find.
If you are sure that there are no issues, and the code and tables need no revision, then return an empty dict: `{}`.

(1) Here is the assessment of the code:

* WRONG FORMULA:
  - The formula for the ANOVA test is correct. It is used to compare the means of the number of interactions across different states.
  - The formula for the linear regression model is correct. It is used to model the number of interactions as a function of the number of
representatives per state, party, and chamber.

* TRIVIALLY-TRUE STATISTICAL TESTS:
  - There are no trivially-true statistical tests in the code. The ANOVA test and the linear regression model are both meaningful and appropriate for
the hypotheses being tested.

* OTHER:
  - There are no other mathematical or statistical issues in the code.

(2) Based on the assessment, there are no issues in the code, so no corrections or improvements are needed. Therefore, the returned dict is empty:

Please follow these two steps:

(1) Check your Python code and return a bullet-point response addressing these points (as applicable):

* DATASET PREPARATIONS:
- Missing values. If applicable, did we deal with missing, unknown, or undefined values, or with special numeric values that stand for
unknown/undefined (check the "Description of the Original Dataset" for any such missing values)?
- Units. If applicable, did we correctly standardize numeric values with different units into same-unit values?
- Data restriction. If applicable, are we restricting the analysis to the correct part of the data (based on the study goal)?

* DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS:
If applicable:
- Did we correctly report descriptive statistics?
- Is the choice of descriptive statistics and chosen variables contribute to the scope of study?
- Is descriptive analysis done on the correct data (for example, before any data normalization steps)?

* PREPROCESSING:
Review the above "Description of the Original Dataset", then check our data preprocessing:
- Are we performing any preprocessing steps that are not needed?
- Are we missing any preprocessing steps that are needed?

* ANALYSIS:
As applicable, check for any data analysis issues, including:
- Analysis that should be performed on the preprocessed data is mistakenly performed on the original data.
- Analysis that should be performed on the original data is mistakenly performed on the preprocessed data.
- Incorrect choice of statistical test.
- Imperfect implementation of statistical tests.
- Did we correctly chose the variables that best represent the tested hypothesis?
- Are we accounting for relevant confounding variables (consult the "Description of the Original Dataset")?
- In linear regression, if interactions terms are included:
  * did we remember to include the main effects?
  * did we use the `*` operator in statsmodels formula as recommended? (as applicable, better use `formula = "y ~ a * b"`, instead of trying to
manually multiply the variables)
- Any other statistical analysis issues.

(2) Based on your assessment above, return a Python Dict[str, str] mapping the issues you have noted
above (dict keys) to specific suggested corrections/improvements in the code (dict values).

For example:

{
    "The model does not adequately account for confounding variables":     "revise the code to add the following confounding variables ...",

    "The descriptive statistics is performed on the wrong data":     "revise the code to perform the descriptive statistics on the preprocessed data.",

(1) Here are the points addressing the code:

* DATASET PREPARATIONS:
- Missing values: The code correctly handles missing values in the 'Interactions' column by filling them with 0.
- Units: All numeric values are in the same unit, so no standardization is needed.
- Data restriction: The code correctly includes all the data in the analysis.

* DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS:
- The code does not include a descriptive statistics table, which is acceptable as per the instructions.

* PREPROCESSING:
- The code correctly creates dummy variables for the categorical variables 'Party' and 'Chamber'.
- No unnecessary preprocessing steps are performed.

* ANALYSIS:
- The analysis is correctly performed on the preprocessed data.
- The choice of statistical tests (ANOVA and linear regression) is appropriate for the hypotheses.
- The implementation of the statistical tests is correct.
- The variables chosen for the analysis correctly represent the tested hypotheses.
- The code correctly accounts for confounding variables by including 'Party' and 'Chamber' in the regression model.

* Sensible numeric values: Check each numeric value in the tables and in the additional results file and make sure it is sensible.
For example:
- If a table reports the mean of a variable, is the mean value sensible?
- If a table reports CI, are the CI values flanking the mean?
- Do values have correct signs?
- Do you see any values that are not sensible (too large, too small)?

* Measures of uncertainty: If a table reports a nominal value (like mean of a variable), does it also report its measures of uncertainty (CI, or STD,
as applicable)?

* Missing data in a table: Are we missing key variables in a given table?

* Missing tables: Considering our research goal and hypothesis testing plan, are all relevant tables created? If not, can you suggest any additional
tables?


* Any other issues you find.

(2) Based on your assessment above, return a Python Dict[str, str] mapping the issues you have noted
above (dict keys) to specific suggested corrections/improvements in the code (dict values).

For example:

{
    "A table is missing":     "revise the code to add the following new table '<your suggested table caption>'",

    "Table <n> reports nominal values without measures of uncertainty":     "revise the code to add STD and p-value.", 
}


Try to be as specific as possible when describing the issues and proposed fixes.
Include in the dict as many issues as you find.
If you are sure that there are no issues, and the code and tables need no revision, then return an empty dict: `{}`.

```latex
\section{Code Explanation}
The provided code performs an analysis on a dataset that represents social interactions among members of the US Congress on Twitter.

First, the code loads the dataset which includes information about the Congress members and their Twitter interactions. It preprocesses the data by
adding a column to the members dataframe that represents the total number of interactions for each member.

Next, the code conducts descriptive statistics on the dataset, but does not generate a descriptive statistics table.

The code then preprocesses the data further by creating dummy variables for the categorical variables 'Party' and 'Chamber'. It also adds a new column
that represents the number of representatives per state.

The analysis consists of two main parts:
1. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA): The code groups the number of interactions by states and performs an ANOVA to determine if there are significant
differences in the mean number of interactions across different states. The results are saved in a table (Table 1) which shows the F-statistic and the
p-value.

2. Linear Regression Analysis: The code performs a linear regression analysis to examine the relationship between the number of interactions and the
variables 'State_Representatives', 'Party', and 'Chamber'. The interaction term is removed due to multicollinearity. The results of the regression
analysis, including the coefficients, p-values, and confidence intervals, are saved in a table (Table 2).

The code also saves additional results in a pickle file ('additional_results.pkl'). These results include the total number of observations, the number
of interactions, the number of states, the average interactions per state, and the average interactions per Congress member.

In summary, the code analyzes the Twitter interactions among members of the US Congress by investigating the differences in interactions across
different states using ANOVA, and examining the relationship between interactions and variables such as the number of representatives per state, party
affiliation, and chamber using linear regression analysis.

[10] COMMENTER -> data_to_latex_code <after_background>  : Background messages completed. Requesting "LaTeX Table Design code".

[11] ---- USER {InterpretationReviewer} -> data_to_latex_code ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please write a Python code to convert and re-style the "table_?.pkl" dataframes created by our "Data Analysis Code" into latex tables suitable for our
scientific paper.

Your code should use the following 3 custom functions provided for import from `my_utils`:


def to_latex_with_note(df, filename: str, caption: str, label: str, note: str = None, legend: Dict[str, str] = None, **kwargs):
    """
    Converts a DataFrame to a LaTeX table with optional note and legend added below the table.

    Parameters:
    - df, filename, caption, label: as in `df.to_latex`.
    - note (optional): Additional note below the table.
    - legend (optional): Dictionary mapping abbreviations to full names.
    - **kwargs: Additional arguments for `df.to_latex`.
    """

def is_str_in_df(df: pd.DataFrame, s: str):
    return any(s in level for level in getattr(df.index, 'levels', [df.index]) + getattr(df.columns, 'levels', [df.columns]))

AbbrToNameDef = Dict[Any, Tuple[Optional[str], Optional[str]]]

def split_mapping(abbrs_to_names_and_definitions: AbbrToNameDef):
    abbrs_to_names = {abbr: name for abbr, (name, definition) in abbrs_to_names_and_definitions.items() if name is not None}
    names_to_definitions = {name or abbr: definition for abbr, (name, definition) in abbrs_to_names_and_definitions.items() if definition is not None}
    return abbrs_to_names, names_to_definitions



Your code should:

* Rename column and row names: You should provide a new name to any column or row label that is abbreviated or technical, or that is otherwise not
self-explanatory.

* Provide legend definitions: You should provide a full definition for any name (or new name) that satisfies any of the following:
- Remains abbreviated, or not self-explanatory, even after renaming.
- Is an ordinal/categorical variable that requires clarification of the meaning of each of its possible values.
- Contains unclear notation, like '*' or ':'
- Represents a numeric variable that has units, that need to be specified.

To avoid re-naming mistakes, you should define for each table a dictionary, `mapping: AbbrToNameDef`, which maps any original column and row names
that are abbreviated or not self-explanatory to an optional new name, and an optional definition.
If different tables share several common labels, then you can build a `shared_mapping`, from which you can extract the relevant labels for each table.

Overall, the code must have the following structure:


# IMPORT
import pandas as pd
from my_utils import to_latex_with_note, is_str_in_df, split_mapping, AbbrToNameDef

# PREPARATION FOR ALL TABLES
# <As applicable, define a shared mapping for labels that are common to all tables. For example:>
shared_mapping: AbbrToNameDef = {
    'AvgAge': ('Avg. Age', 'Average age, years'),
    'BT': ('Body Temperature', '1: Normal, 2: High, 3: Very High'),
    'W': ('Weight', 'Participant weight, kg'),
    'MRSA': (None, 'Infected with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 1: Yes, 0: No'),
    ...: (..., ...),
}
# <This is of course just an example. Consult with the "Description of the Original Dataset" and the "Data Analysis Code" for choosing the labels and their proper scientific names and definitions.>

# TABLE 1:
df1 = pd.read_pickle('table_1.pkl')

# FORMAT VALUES <include this sub-section only as applicable>
# <Rename technical values to scientifically-suitable values. For example:>
df1['MRSA'] = df1['MRSA'].apply(lambda x: 'Yes' if x == 1 else 'No')

# RENAME ROWS AND COLUMNS <include this sub-section only as applicable>
# <Rename any abbreviated or not self-explanatory table labels to scientifically-suitable names.>
# <Use the `shared_mapping` if applicable. For example:>
mapping1 = dict((k, v) for k, v in shared_mapping.items() if is_str_in_df(df1, k)) 
mapping1 |= {
    'PV': ('P-value', None),
    'CI': (None, '95% Confidence Interval'),
    'Sex_Age': ('Age * Sex', 'Interaction term between Age and Sex'),
}
abbrs_to_names1, legend1 = split_mapping(mapping1)
df1 = df1.rename(columns=abbrs_to_names1, index=abbrs_to_names1)

# SAVE AS LATEX:
to_latex_with_note(
    df1, 'table_1.tex',
    caption="<choose a caption suitable for a table in a scientific paper>", 
    label='table:<chosen table label>',
    note="<If needed, add a note to provide any additional information that is not captured in the caption>",
    legend=legend1)


# TABLE <?>:
# <etc, all 'table_?.pkl' files>


Avoid the following:
Do not provide a sketch or pseudocode; write a complete runnable code including all '# HEADERS' sections.
Do not create any graphics, figures or any plots.
Do not send any presumed output examples.

There are some issues that need to be corrected:

# Problem with table caption/label
* table_1.tex:
The caption of the table should not start with "Table ..."

* table_2.tex:
The caption of the table should not start with "Table ..."

Please revise the code making sure all tables are created with a caption and a label.
Use the arguments `caption` and `label` of the function `to_latex_with_note`.
Captions should be suitable for a table in a scientific paper.
Labels should be in the format `table:<your table label here>`.
In addition, you can add:
- an optional note for further explanations (use the argument `note` of the function `to_latex_with_note`)
- a legend mapping any abbreviated row/column labels to their definitions (use the argument `legend` of the function `to_latex_with_note`)


Please rewrite the complete code again with these issues corrected.

GENERAL FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
Even if you are changing just a few lines, you must return the complete code again in a single code block, including the unchanged parts, so that I
can just copy-paste and run it.
Remember, your code must contain the following sections:

# Table row/column labels contain un-allowed characters
Table table_2.tex has index labels containing the character "_" (underscore), which is not allowed.
Here are the problematic index labels:
['State_Representatives']

Please revise the code to map these index labels to new names that do not contain the "_" characters.

Doublecheck to make sure your code uses `df.rename(index=...)` with the `index=` arg.

\title{Characterizing Tweet Interactions among U.S. Congress Members: Influence of Party Affiliation, Chamber, and State Representation Size}

\begin{abstract}
This study innovatively explores the importance of party affiliation, chamber of representation (House or Senate), and the size of a state's
delegation on the number of Twitter interactions among U.S. Congress members. Despite growing interest in leveraging social media interactions for
political science research, an integrative investigation of Twitter interactions within Congress remains untapped. Leveraging a unique dataset, we
track interpersonal Twitter interactions for members of the 117th U.S. Congress over a four-month period in 2022, yielding fruitful insights. Through
descriptive and inferential statistical methods, we demonstrate notable findings. The number of Twitter interactions appears not to vary significantly
among different states' political representatives. Furthermore, although chamber of service and party affiliation were not significant determinants of
interaction volume, the number of representatives in a state showed a significant positive association with Twitter interactions. Notwithstanding some
limitations, including potential omitted variables and the specificity of the examined Twitter timeframe, these results largely serve as novel
empirical evidence countering the assumption that polarization drives Congress members' Twitter interactions. Instead, the findings suggest the
importance of considering the total number of state representatives in understanding Congressional dynamics. The implications of the study potentially
recalibrate scholarly and public perceptions of U.S. political communications on social media platforms.

\title{Tweet Interactions among U.S. Congress Members Reflect State Representation Size Rather than Polarization}

\begin{abstract}
This study investigates the role of party affiliation, chamber of service (House or Senate), and the size of a state's delegation in the volume of
Twitter interactions among U.S. Congress members. Despite the undeniable importance of social media in political discourse, the nuanced dynamics
governing Twitter interactions within the U.S. Congress have remained largely unexplored. We fill this void by analyzing a unique dataset of Twitter
interactions for the members of the 117th U.S. Congress over a four-month period in 2022. Using both descriptive and inferential statistical methods,
our study yields several noteworthy findings. Interestingly, the volume of Twitter interactions does not seem to be significantly linked to the states
that members represent. Moreover, we uncover that party affiliation and chamber of service are not significant determining factors of interaction
volume. However, the size of state delegations correlates significantly with the extent of Twitter interactions. While our study is not immune to
potential limitations, including possible omitted variables and the specific timeframe of the Twitter data, our findings shed valuable light on
Congressional dynamics. It is not polarization, but the more pragmatic factor of representation size that guides Congress members' Twitter
interactions. This empirical insight could help adjust scholarly and public perceptions of political communication dynamics within the U.S. Congress
on social media platforms.

- Title: The title is concise, meaningful, and does not include any punctuation marks. However, it might be slightly misleading since it suggests
polarization is not reflected at all in the Twitter interactions, which is not exactly evident from the analysis. Consider adjusting it to more
precisely reflect the findings. Perhaps something along the lines of: "U.S. Congress Members' Twitter Interactions: More Reflective of State
Representation Size than Party Polarization".

- Abstract:
   - The introductory part does a good job of stating the importance of the subject and the research gap. However, changing "This study
investigates..." to a more active phrasing might make it more engaging. For instance: "We investigate the role of party affiliation..."
   - The description of the dataset used is clear and non-technical but the methodology section might be better served by stating that you employ
quantitative analysis or statistical modeling without technical jargon.
   - The statement of the main results is well-written and summarizes the main results appropriately. It successfully refers to the insights from the
tables without mentioning specific numeric values. However, reference to 'polarization' might slightly overreach the evidence presented in the dataset
analysis, as we are only looking at party affiliation, not direct measures of political polarization. This might need to be clarified.
   - In the limitations part of the abstract, instead of citing "possible omitted variables" which is vague, you should consider mentioning the
limitation of analyzing a four-month period within a specific year as this might not fully capture long-term trends in the Twitter interactions among
the U.S. Congress members.
   - The implications section does well to highlight the potential usefulness of the findings, but it might be worth noting that further research is
needed to fully comprehend the dynamics of political communication within social media platforms.

\title{U.S. Congress Members' Twitter Interactions: More Reflective of State Representation Size than Party Affiliation}

\begin{abstract}
We investigate the impact of party affiliation, chamber of service, and the size of a state's delegation on the volume of Twitter interactions amongst
U.S. Congress members. Given the critical role of social media in contemporary political discourse, it is paramount to shed light on the underlying
dynamics of these interactions, a topic previously under-explored. Employing a unique dataset that maps Twitter interactions of members from the 117th
U.S. Congress over a four-month period in 2022, we conduct a quantitative analysis to yield several notable insights. Intriguingly, our findings
suggest that the member's represented state does not significantly influence the volume of their Twitter interactions. Furthermore, contrary to
popular beliefs surrounding political polarization, neither party affiliation nor chamber of service emerges as a decisive factor. Instead, the size
of the state delegations appears to significantly correlate with the extent of Twitter interactions. Whilst it is crucial to consider the limitations
of our study, particularly the short-duration, single-year scope of our dataset, the implications of our findings carry noteworthy weight. They
suggest that it is representation size, not party affiliation, which may have stronger bearings on the dynamics of Congress members' Twitter
interactions, underscoring the necessity for further research in this domain.

We investigate the impact of party affiliation, chamber of service, and the size of a state's delegation on the volume of Twitter interactions amongst
U.S. Congress members. Given the critical role of social media in contemporary political discourse, it is paramount to shed light on the underlying

[11] ---- USER {CitationExpert} -> literature_search_writing -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please write literature-search queries that we can use to search for papers related to our study.

You would need to compose search queries to identify prior papers covering these 4 areas:
"background": papers that provide background on the overall subject of our study
"dataset": papers that use the same or similar datasets as in our study
"methods": papers that use the same or similar methods as in our study
"results": papers that report results similar to our study

Return your answer as a `Dict[str, List[str]]`, where the keys are the 4 areas noted above, and the values are lists of query string. Each individual
query should be a string with up to 5-10 words.

For example, for a study reporting waning of the efficacy of the covid-19 BNT162b2 vaccine based on analysis of the "United Kingdom National Core Data
(UK-NCD)", the queries could be:

{
    "background": ['SARS-CoV2 spread', 'covid-19 global impact', 'covid-19 vaccine']
    "dataset": ['The UK-NCD dataset', 'covid-19 vaccine efficacy dataset']
    "methods": ['covid-19 vaccine efficacy analysis', 'kaplan-meier survival analysis']
    "results": ['covid-19 vaccine efficacy', 'covid-19 vaccine efficacy over time', 'covid-19 vaccine waning']

DESCRIPTION OF THE ORIGINAL DATASET (with hypertargets)

* Rationale:
The dataset maps US Congress's Twitter interactions into a directed graph with social interactions (edges) among Congress members (nodes). Each member
(node) is further characterized by three attributes: Represented State, Political Party, and Chamber, allowing analysis of the adjacency matrix
structure, graph metrics and likelihood of interactions across these attributes.

* Data Collection and Network Construction:
Twitter data of members of the \hypertarget{S0a}{117}th US Congress, from both the House and the Senate, were harvested for a
\hypertarget{S0b}{4}-month period, February \hypertarget{S0c}{9} to June \hypertarget{S0d}{9}, \hypertarget{S0e}{2022} (using the Twitter API).
Members with fewer than \hypertarget{S0f}{100} tweets were excluded from the network.

- `Nodes`. Nodes represent Congress members. Each node is designated an integer node ID (\hypertarget{S1a}{0}, \hypertarget{S1b}{1},
\hypertarget{S1c}{2}, ...) which corresponds to a row in `congress_members.csv`, providing the member's Represented State, Political Party, and
Chamber.

- `Edges`. A directed edge from node i to node j indicates that member i engaged with member j on Twitter at least once during the
\hypertarget{S2a}{4}-month data-collection period. An engagement is defined as a tweet by member i that mentions member j's handle, or as retweets,
quote tweets, or replies of i to a tweet by member j.


* Data analysis guidelines:
- Your analysis code should NOT create tables that include names of Congress members, or their Twitter handles.
- Your analysis code should NOT create tables that include names of States, or their two-letter abbreviations. The code may of course do statistical
analysis of *properties* related to States, but should not single out specific states.


2 data files:
File #1: "congress_members.csv"
A csv file of members of the \hypertarget{T0a}{117}th Congress, including their Twitter handles, Represented State, Party, and Chamber.
Data source: `https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/members-official-twitter-handles`.
Rows are ordered according to the node ID, starting at \hypertarget{T1a}{0}.

Fields:

`Handle`: Twitter handle (without `@`)
`State`: Categorical; Two-letter state abbreviation; including also: "DC", "PR", "VI", "AS", "GU", "MP".
`Party`: Categorical; Party affiliation ("D", "R", or "I")
`Chamber`: Categorical; The member's chamber ("House", "Senate")


Here are the first few lines of the file:
```output
Handle,State,Party,Chamber
SenatorBaldwin,WI,D,Senate
SenJohnBarrasso,WY,R,Senate
SenatorBennet,CO,D,Senate

```

File #2: "congress_edges.dat"
This file provides the interaction network between members of the \hypertarget{U0a}{115}th US Congress on Twitter.
Download and adapted from: `https://snap.stanford.edu/data/congress-twitter`

Each line contains two integers (i, j), indicating a directed edge from node ID i to node ID j, compatible with nx.read_edgelist('congress_edges.dat',
create_using=nx.DiGraph()). An i->j edge indicates that Congress member i had at least one tweet engaging with Congress member j during the
\hypertarget{U1a}{4}-month collection period.

Thank you for the Additional Results (additional_results.pkl) with hypertargets.
======================================================================================================================================================

[12] COMMENTER -> results <after_background>  : Background messages completed. Requesting "`Results` section".

[13] ---- USER {Writer} -> results -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on the material provided above ("Title and Abstract", "Description of the Original Dataset", "Data Analysis Code", "Tables of the Paper with
hypertargets", "Additional Results (additional_results.pkl) with hypertargets"), please write only the `Results` section for a Nature Communications
article.
Do not write any other parts!

Use the following guidelines when writing the Results:

* Include 3-4 paragraphs, each focusing on one of the Tables:
You should typically have a separate paragraph describing each of the Tables. In each such paragraph, indicate the motivation/question for the
analysis, the methodology, and only then describe the results. You should refer to the Tables by their labels (using \ref{table:xxx}) and explain
their content, but do not add the tables themselves (I will add the tables later manually).

* Story-like flow:
It is often nice to have a story-like flow between the paragraphs, so that the reader can follow the analysis process with emphasis on the
reasoning/motivation behind each analysis step.
For example, the first sentence of each paragraph can be a story-guiding sentences like:
"First, to understand whether xxx, we conducted a simple analysis of ..."; "Then, to test yyy, we performed a ..."; "Finally, to further verify the
effect of zzz, we tested whether ...".

* Conclude with a summary of the results:
You can summarize the results at the end, with a sentence like: "In summary, these results show ...", or "Taken together, these results suggest ...".
IMPORTANT NOTE: Your summary SHOULD NOT include a discussion of conclusions, implications, limitations, or of future work. (These will be added later
as part the Discussion section, not the Results section).

* Numeric values:

- Source:
You can extract numeric values from the above provided: "Tables of the Paper with hypertargets", "Additional Results (additional_results.pkl) with
hypertargets", and "Description of the Original Dataset".

- Format:
Any numeric value extracted from the above sources should be written with a proper \hyperlink to its corresponding source \hypertarget.

- Calculating dependent values using `\num` command.
You can use \num{formula} to calculate dependent values from the provided numeric values (the formula will be automatically replaced with the actual
numeric values in pdf compilation).
The \num formula should be used whenever you would like mentioning a numeric value that is not explicitly provided in the above sources, but could
rather be derived from them.
For example, use the \num syntax for: changing units, calculating differences, transforming regression coefficients into odds ratios, etc. (see
examples below).

- Toy example for citing and calculating numeric values:

Suppose the provided source data includes:
```
No-drug average response: \hypertarget{Z1a}{65.4}
With-drug average response: \hypertarget{Z2a}{87.3}
Regression coef: \hypertarget{Z3a}{1.234}; STD: \hypertarget{Z3b}{0.123}; Pvalue: \hypertarget{Z3c}{0.017}
```

Then, here are some examples of proper ways to include these source values as well as derived values:

-- Citing the raw values:
"The control group had an average response of \hyperlink{Z1a}{65.4} and the treatment group had an average response of \hyperlink{Z2a}{87.3}."

"The regression coefficient was \hyperlink{Z3a}{1.234} with a standard deviation of \hyperlink{Z3b}{0.123} (P-value: \hyperlink{Z3c}{0.017})."

-- Citing dependent values using the \num command:
"The difference in average response was \num{\hyperlink{Z2a}{87.3} - \hyperlink{Z1a}{65.4}}."

"The regression coefficient was \hyperlink{Z3a}{1.234} (STD: \hyperlink{Z3b}{0.123}) corresponding to an odds ratio of
\num{exp(\hyperlink{Z3a}{1.234})} (CI:
\num{exp(\hyperlink{Z3a}{1.234} - 1.96 * \hyperlink{Z3b}{0.123})}, \num{exp(\hyperlink{Z3a}{1.234} + 1.96 * \hyperlink{Z3b}{0.123})})."

* Accuracy:
Make sure that you are only mentioning details that are explicitly found within the Tables and Numerical Values.

* Unknown values:
If we need to include a numeric value that is not explicitly given in the Tables or "Additional Results (additional_results.pkl) with hypertargets",
and cannot be derived from them using the \num command, then indicate `[unknown]` instead of the numeric value.

For example:
"The no-drug average response was \hypertarget{Z1a}{65.4} (STD: [unknown])."


Write in tex format, escaping any math or symbols that needs tex escapes.

\section{Results}

First, to understand the differences in Twitter interactions by the geographical location of Congress members, we conducted an analysis of variance
(ANOVA) based on States. The F-statistic obtained was \hyperlink{A0a}{0.691} with a p-value of \hyperlink{A0b}{0.951}
(Table~\ref{table:anova_interactions}), indicating no statistically significant difference in interaction counts among Congress members from different
states.

Building upon this, to investigate the influence of party affiliation, chamber of service, and the size of a state's delegation on the volume of these
Twitter interactions, we performed a linear regression analysis. The results of this analysis are reported in Table~\ref{table:regress_interactions}.
Neither party affiliation nor chamber of service showed a significant association with the number of interactions. Specifically, Independent and
Republican party affiliations yielded coefficients of \hyperlink{B2a}{-2.94} (p = \hyperlink{B2b}{0.822}) and \hyperlink{B3a}{0.797} (p =
\hyperlink{B3b}{0.641}), respectively, relative to the Democratic party. The Senate chamber, compared to the House, presented a higher coefficient of
\hyperlink{B4a}{3.26} but had a p-value of \hyperlink{B4b}{0.142}, thereby failing to establish statistical significance.

Interestingly, the number of representatives per state emerged as a strong predictor of the volume of Twitter interactions, with a coefficient of
\hyperlink{B5a}{0.164} (p = \hyperlink{B5b}{0.0118}). This suggests that, for every additional representative a state has in Congress, the expectation
of Twitter interactions amongst its Congress members increases by \num{\hyperlink{B5a}{0.164}}.

To summarize, these results reveal no meaningful influence by the state of representation on the volume of Twitter interactions amongst U.S. Congress
members. Moreover, contrary to popular narratives surrounding political polarization, neither party affiliation nor the chamber of service were
decisive factors. Instead, the size of the state delegation, portrayed by the number of state representatives, displayed a significant correlation
with the extent of Twitter interactions.

\section{Results}

First, to understand whether geological variances influence Congress members' Twitter interactions, we perform an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for
interactions grouped by States. Our results, shown in Table \ref{table:anova_interactions}, indicated no significant difference in the number of
interactions among Congress members from different states. The F-statistic was \hyperlink{A0a}{0.691}, and the p-value was \hyperlink{A0b}{0.951},
suggesting State representation does not significantly alter the volume of Twitter interactions.

Subsequently, to scrutinize the effect of party affiliation, chamber of service, and the number of representatives per state on Twitter interactions,
we conduct a linear regression analysis where these factors become independent variables. Our results, as represented by Table
\ref{table:regress_interactions}, unveil intriguing facets. Neither party affiliation nor chamber showed substantial association with the number of
interactions. The coefficients for the Independent and Republican party affiliations were \hyperlink{B2a}{-2.94} (p = \hyperlink{B2b}{0.822}) and
\hyperlink{B3a}{0.797} (p = \hyperlink{B3b}{0.641}), respectively. For Congress members serving in the Senate, the coefficient was
\hyperlink{B4a}{3.26}, but with a p-value of \hyperlink{B4b}{0.142}, thereby implying statistical insignificance.

However, the size of the state’s delegation, indicated by the number of representatives per state, emerged as a concrete predictor of Twitter
interactions volume. The coefficient for this variable was \hyperlink{B5a}{0.164}, and its p-value was \hyperlink{B5b}{0.0118}.

Summarizing our findings, results suggest that neither state of representation, chamber of service, nor party affiliation significantly mold the
volume of Twitter interactions amongst U.S. Congress members. Instead, it's the size of each state delegation that appears to correlate significantly
with the quantity of Twitter interactions.

- The introductory sentence for the first paragraph is unclear. The term "geological variances" is vague and not consistent with the provided
information. Consider modifying the sentence to explicitly mention that the aspect under scrutiny is the number of Twitter interactions among Congress
members grouped by the represented States.
- In the second paragraph, clarify that the coefficients for the Independent and Republican parties and the Senate relate to their effect on the
number of Twitter interactions.
- The conclusion sentence of the second paragraph is misleading; it hints that the Senate's effect is not significant due to the p-value. However,
traditionally a p-value lower than 0.05 is considered statistically significant, whereas a p-value lower than 0.1 but higher than 0.05 is often
considered to indicate a statistical trend. Therefore, consider mentioning that the p-value for the Senate indicates a statistical trend rather than
'implying statistical insignificance'.
- In the third paragraph, consider explaining the specific meaning of the coefficient for the number of representatives per state. While stating the
coefficient value is 'concrete', in context, it means that for each additional representative in a Congress member's state, their expected number of
interactions increases by the coefficient value on average, assuming other variables are constant.
- In the final summary paragraph, replace the phrase 'mold the volume of Twitter interactions' with a more conventional phrase like 'significantly

\section{Results}

To examine if the represented state significantly influences the number of Twitter interactions among U.S. Congress members, we conducted an analysis
of variance (ANOVA) grouping interactions by States. As depicted in Table \ref{table:anova_interactions}, the F-statistic was \hyperlink{A0a}{0.691},
accompanied by a p-value of \hyperlink{A0b}{0.951}, demonstrating that the state of representation does not significantly alter the Twitter
interactions volume.

Following this, we engaged in a linear regression analysis to scrutinize the impact of party affiliation, chamber of service, and the number of
representatives per state on Congress members' Twitter interactions. As detailed in Table \ref{table:regress_interactions}, neither party affiliation
nor chamber showed a substantial association with the number of interactions. The coefficients for the Independent and Republican party affiliations,
indicating their respective impacts on interaction count, were \hyperlink{B2a}{-2.94} (p = \hyperlink{B2b}{0.822}) and \hyperlink{B3a}{0.797} (p =
\hyperlink{B3b}{0.641}) respectively, indicating no significant effect. The coefficient for Congress members serving in the Senate was
\hyperlink{B4a}{3.26}, with a corresponding p-value of \hyperlink{B4b}{0.142}, suggesting a statistical trend, albeit not firmly conclusive.

Interestingly, our examination revealed the size of the state delegation, indicated by the number of representatives from each state, to be a robust
predictor of interaction volumes. The coefficient for this factor was \hyperlink{B5a}{0.164} with a p-value of \hyperlink{B5b}{0.0118}. This suggests
that for each additional representative in a Congress member's state, their mean number of interactions increases by \hyperlink{B5a}{0.164}, assuming
all else constant.

In summary, these findings suggest that individual state of representation, the chamber of service, or party affiliation do not significantly affect
the volume of Twitter interactions amongst U.S. Congress members. Instead, it's the delegation size from respective states that significantly
correlates with the extent of Twitter interactions.

\section{Results}

To examine if the represented state significantly influences the number of Twitter interactions among U.S. Congress members, we conducted an analysis
of variance (ANOVA) grouping interactions by States. As depicted in Table \ref{table:anova_interactions}, the F-statistic was \hyperlink{A0a}{0.691},
accompanied by a p-value of \hyperlink{A0b}{0.951}, demonstrating that the state of representation does not significantly alter the Twitter
interactions volume.

Following this, we engaged in a linear regression analysis to scrutinize the impact of party affiliation, chamber of service, and the number of
representatives per state on Congress members' Twitter interactions. As detailed in Table \ref{table:regress_interactions}, neither party affiliation
nor chamber showed a substantial association with the number of interactions. The coefficients for the Independent and Republican party affiliations,
indicating their respective impacts on interaction count, were \hyperlink{B2a}{-2.94} (p = \hyperlink{B2b}{0.822}) and \hyperlink{B3a}{0.797} (p =

\hyperlink{B4a}{3.26}, with a corresponding p-value of \hyperlink{B4b}{0.142}, suggesting a statistical trend, albeit not firmly conclusive.

Interestingly, our examination revealed the size of the state delegation, indicated by the number of representatives from each state, to be a robust

\title{Twitter Interactions Among US Congress Members: The Dominance of Representation Size}

\begin{abstract}
Twitter, a primary platform for political discourse in the U.S., allows Congress members to engage with one another and with the community at large.
Yet, the factors that influence these interactions, crucial for understanding political communication, remain inadequately explored. In this in-depth
analysis, we leverage a unique dataset capturing the Twitter engagements among the 117th U.S. Congress over four months in 2022. Adopting quantitative
data analysis techniques, we delve into how factors such as party affiliation, chamber of service, and state's delegation size modulate the volume of
Twitter interactions. Our findings compellingly reveal that chamber and party, contrary to expectations, have minimal bearing on interaction volumes.
Instead, delegations' size emerges as a robust predictor. Each additional representative within a Congress member's state incrementally increases
their average number of Twitter interactions. However, we must acknowledge the limitations of our study, given our reliance on a dataset scoped to a
single year and a relatively narrow duration. Nevertheless, our results indicate that representation size holds more sway over congress members'
Twitter exchanges than party lines—a finding that necessitates further investigation into the underpinnings of political discourse on social media.

\title{Representation Size Governs Twitter Interactions Among US Congress Members}

\begin{abstract}
The dynamics of Twitter interaction among U.S. Congress members provide a unique lens into political communication in the contemporary era of social
media. However, a comprehensive understanding of these interactions, particularly their influencing factors, remains elusive. This study leverages a
unique dataset featuring Twitter interactions among the 117th U.S. Congress members captured over four months in 2022, to address this gap. We apply
robust quantitative methods to evaluate the influence of party affiliation, chamber of service, and state's delegation size on Twitter interaction
volume. Our findings reveal an unexpected narrative: neither the party nor the chamber have a substantial impact on interaction volumes. Instead, a
strong correlation emerges with delegation size, with each additional representative from a state significantly boosting a Congress member's mean
Twitter interactions. While our study is constrained by the duration and yearly scope of the dataset, it illuminates an important conclusion:
representation size commands a more prominent role than party lines in shaping Twitter exchanges among Congress members, providing a novel direction
for further exploration in political communication research on social media.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Data Source}
The data required for the analysis was derived from two sources. A tabular file with attributive data about members of the 117th U.S. Congress,
including the states they represent, their party affiliations, and their chamber of service, was compiled. In addition, a social network graph was
constructed depicting Twitter interactions between Congress members.

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
The preprocessing phase involved integrating data from the two sources into a unified format. Each Congress member in the attributive dataset was
assigned their respective node id from the social network. The volume of Twitter interactions, defined as tweets, retweets, replies or quote tweets,
for each member was calculated based on directed arcs in the social network graph. The inferred interaction volumes were then added as an additional
attribute to the Congress members dataset.The attributive data was subsequently processed to generate categorical indicators for the party affiliation
and chamber of service attributes. Moreover, the total number of Congress members from each member’s state was computed, effectively indicating the
size of the state's delegation in Congress.

\subsection{Data Analysis}
Our analysis ventured to explore the impact of party affiliation, chamber of service, and delegation size on the volume of Twitter interactions among
Congress members. Initially, an analysis of variance was performed to compare the mean interaction volume across different states, without considering
other attributive characteristics of the Congress members. The purpose of this step was to identify states that significantly deviate from the
population mean, thus hinting at the potential influence of the state's representation size on interaction volume.

Next, a multivariate analysis was carried out to assess how party affiliation, chamber of service, and number of state representatives are
collectively associated with a member's Twitter interaction volume. To this end, a multiple linear regression model was used with interaction volume
as the response variable, while party affiliation (categorical), chamber of service (categorical), and number of state representatives (continuous)
served as explanatory variables. Interaction terms were excluded from the model due to multi-collinearity issues. This step permitted the
identification of significant predictors among the explored factors while accounting for the presence of the other factors in the model.

All analyses were performed through standard statistical techniques under the assumption of independence and appropriate distribution of residuals,
ensuring accuracy and robustness of the results. Before the analysis, the data was inspected and cleaned as needed to safeguard against violations of
these assumptions.

Here is the Methods section of the paper:

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Data Source}
The data required for the analysis was derived from two sources. A tabular file with attributive data about members of the 117th U.S. Congress,
including the states they represent, their party affiliations, and their chamber of service, was compiled. In addition, a social network graph was
constructed depicting Twitter interactions between Congress members.

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
The preprocessing phase involved integrating data from the two sources into a unified format. Each Congress member in the attributive dataset was
assigned their respective node id from the social network. The volume of Twitter interactions, defined as tweets, retweets, replies or quote tweets,
for each member was calculated based on directed arcs in the social network graph. The inferred interaction volumes were then added as an additional
attribute to the Congress members dataset.The attributive data was subsequently processed to generate categorical indicators for the party affiliation
and chamber of service attributes. Moreover, the total number of Congress members from each member's state was computed, effectively indicating the
size of the state's delegation in Congress.

\subsection{Data Analysis}
Our analysis ventured to explore the impact of party affiliation, chamber of service, and delegation size on the volume of Twitter interactions among
Congress members. Initially, an analysis of variance was performed to compare the mean interaction volume across different states, without considering
other attributive characteristics of the Congress members. The purpose of this step was to identify states that significantly deviate from the
population mean, thus hinting at the potential influence of the state's representation size on interaction volume.

Next, a multivariate analysis was carried out to assess how party affiliation, chamber of service, and number of state representatives are
collectively associated with a member's Twitter interaction volume. To this end, a multiple linear regression model was used with interaction volume
as the response variable, while party affiliation (categorical), chamber of service (categorical), and number of state representatives (continuous)
served as explanatory variables. Interaction terms were excluded from the model due to multi-collinearity issues. This step permitted the
identification of significant predictors among the explored factors while accounting for the presence of the other factors in the model.

All analyses were performed through standard statistical techniques under the assumption of independence and appropriate distribution of residuals,
ensuring accuracy and robustness of the results. Before the analysis, the data was inspected and cleaned as needed to safeguard against violations of
these assumptions.\subsection{Code Availability}

Custom code used to perform the data preprocessing and analysis, as well as the raw code outputs, are provided in Supplementary Methods.

Based on the material provided above ("Overall Description of the Dataset", "Title and Abstract", "Background-related Literature Search", "Results-
related Literature Search", "Dataset-related Literature Search", "Methods-related Literature Search", "Methods Section of the Paper", "Results Section
of the Paper"), please write only the `Introduction` section for a Nature Communications article.
Do not write any other parts!

The introduction should be interesting and pique your reader’s interest.
It should be written while citing relevant papers from the Literature Searches above.

Specifically, the introduction should follow the following multi-paragraph structure:

* Introduce the topic of the paper and why it is important (cite relevant papers from the above "Background-related Literature Search").

* Explain what was already done and known on the topic, and what is then the research gap/question (cite relevant papers from the above "Results-
related Literature Search"). If there is only a minor gap, you can use language such as "Yet, it is still unclear ...", "However, less is known about
...", etc.

* State how the current paper addresses this gap/question (cite relevant papers from the above "Dataset-related Literature Search" and "Results-
related Literature Search").

* Outline the methodological procedure and briefly state the main findings (cite relevant papers from the above "Methods-related Literature Search")

Note: each of these paragraphs should be 5-6 sentence long. Do not just write short paragraphs with less than 5 sentences!

Citations should be added in the following format: \cite{paper_id}.
Do not add a \section{References} section, I will add it later manually.

Note that it is not advisable to write about limitations, implications, or impact in the introduction.

Write in tex format, escaping any math or symbols that needs tex escapes.

The `Introduction` section should be enclosed within triple-backtick "latex" code block, like this:

```latex
\section{<section name>}

\section{Introduction}

Social media platforms, particularly Twitter, have increasingly become a vital medium for political discourse and communication
\cite{Ausserhofer2013NATIONALPO, Stier2018ElectionCO, Jungherr2016TwitterUI}. They offer an unprecedented window into the dynamics of political
interaction among representatives, such as the U.S. Congress members, which can provide key insights into the political landscape
\cite{Bail2019AssessingTR, Mendelsohn2021ModelingFI, Enli2013PERSONALIZEDCI}. This begs the question: what factors drive Twitter interactions among
Congress members?

Previous research has shed light on several aspects of political communication on Twitter. Notably, the role of ideology and political beliefs has
been investigated \cite{Theocharis2020TheDO, Lu2019TheEO, Hemphill2013FramingIS}, as well as the contribution of geographic and demographic factors
\cite{Pablo2014TowardAE, Henn2014SocialDI}. Yet, it is still unclear how intra-organizational attributes such as party affiliation, chamber of
service, and state's delegation size influence Twitter interactions among Congress members. This gap in our understanding limits our ability to paint
a complete picture of political communication dynamics in the era of social media.

In this study, we address this research gap by leveraging a unique dataset of Twitter interactions among members of the 117th U.S. Congress over four
months in 2022 \cite{Hemphill2013WhatsCD, Barber2019WhoLW, Peng2016FollowerFolloweeNC}. Additionally, we apply robust quantitative methods previously
utilized in related studies to appraise the influence of party affiliation, chamber of service, and delegation size on Twitter interactions
\cite{VanderWeele2014OnTC, Stewart2000TheIO, Hu2015PredictingUE}.

Through an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple linear regression, we were able to measure the impact of these factors on the volume of Twitter
interactions. Our findings reveal a nuanced narrative, where delegation size emerges as a prominent determinant of interaction volumes, while party
affiliation and chamber of service prove less influential \cite{Walraven2009AMO,Anderson2017SocialMS}. This study offers a compelling new direction
for the exploration of political communication in the social media landscape.

\section{Introduction}

Political communication in the era of social media has garnered increasing scholarly interest due to its transformative influences on political
dynamics and public discourse \cite{Ausserhofer2013NATIONALPO, Stier2018ElectionCO, Jungherr2016TwitterUI}. Twitter, as a particularly vibrant
platform for political interaction, provides a unique prism through which the interaction dynamics among political representatives can be explored.
Understanding these dynamics among U.S. Congress members bears significant importance; their interactions can serve as indicators of broader political
trends, alliances, and conflicts, thereby facilitating in-depth insights into the political landscape of one of the most influential democratic
nations globally \cite{Bail2019AssessingTR, Mendelsohn2021ModelingFI, Enli2013PERSONALIZEDCI}.

The role of various factors on political Twitter interactions has been the cornerstone of a prolific line of research. Existing works offer revealing
insights into the influence of ideological alignment and political beliefs on Twitter exchanges among politicians \cite{Theocharis2020TheDO,
Lu2019TheEO}. Other studies have illuminated the impact of geographic and demographic variables on these interactions \cite{Pablo2014TowardAE,
Henn2014SocialDI}. However, a thorough understanding of how intra-organizational attributes, such as party affiliation, chamber of service, and the
state's delegation size, influence Twitter interactions among Congress members remains elusive. Unraveling this aspect is critical to attaining a
holistic understanding of political communication dynamics on social media platforms.

To address this gap, our study leverages a unique dataset that captures Twitter interactions among the 117th U.S. Congress members over a four-month
period in 2022 \cite{Hemphill2013WhatsCD, Barber2019WhoLW}. This dataset is rich, encompassing not only interaction data but also key attributes like
party affiliation, chamber of service, and state representation details \cite{Peng2016FollowerFolloweeNC}. We use this data to interrogate the
association of these intra-organizational factors with Twitter interaction volumes among Congress members.

Employing robust quantitative methods, as informed by prior research \cite{VanderWeele2014OnTC, Stewart2000TheIO, Hu2015PredictingUE}, we conducted an
analysis of variance and multiple linear regression to accurately quantify the influence of the party affiliation, chamber of service, and the size of
the state delegation on Twitter interaction volume. Our findings narrate an intriguing story; while party affiliation and chamber of service do not
significantly influence interaction volume, the size of the state delegation emerges as a prominent, albeit not the only, determinant of interaction
volume \cite{Walraven2009AMO,Anderson2017SocialMS}. This underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of Twitter interactions among Congress
members, transcending the traditional party lines, and chamber divisions.

Here is the Introduction section of the paper:

\section{Introduction}

Political communication in the era of social media has garnered increasing scholarly interest due to its transformative influences on political
dynamics and public discourse \cite{Ausserhofer2013NATIONALPO, Stier2018ElectionCO, Jungherr2016TwitterUI}. Twitter, as a particularly vibrant
platform for political interaction, provides a unique prism through which the interaction dynamics among political representatives can be explored.
Understanding these dynamics among U.S. Congress members bears significant importance; their interactions can serve as indicators of broader political
trends, alliances, and conflicts, thereby facilitating in-depth insights into the political landscape of one of the most influential democratic
nations globally \cite{Bail2019AssessingTR, Mendelsohn2021ModelingFI, Enli2013PERSONALIZEDCI}.

The role of various factors on political Twitter interactions has been the cornerstone of a prolific line of research. Existing works offer revealing
insights into the influence of ideological alignment and political beliefs on Twitter exchanges among politicians \cite{Theocharis2020TheDO,
Lu2019TheEO}. Other studies have illuminated the impact of geographic and demographic variables on these interactions \cite{Pablo2014TowardAE,
Henn2014SocialDI}. However, a thorough understanding of how intra-organizational attributes, such as party affiliation, chamber of service, and the
state's delegation size, influence Twitter interactions among Congress members remains elusive. Unraveling this aspect is critical to attaining a
holistic understanding of political communication dynamics on social media platforms.

To address this gap, our study leverages a unique dataset that captures Twitter interactions among the 117th U.S. Congress members over a four-month
period in 2022 \cite{Hemphill2013WhatsCD, Barber2019WhoLW}. This dataset is rich, encompassing not only interaction data but also key attributes like
party affiliation, chamber of service, and state representation details \cite{Peng2016FollowerFolloweeNC}. We use this data to interrogate the
association of these intra-organizational factors with Twitter interaction volumes among Congress members.

Employing robust quantitative methods, as informed by prior research \cite{VanderWeele2014OnTC, Stewart2000TheIO, Hu2015PredictingUE}, we conducted an
analysis of variance and multiple linear regression to accurately quantify the influence of the party affiliation, chamber of service, and the size of
the state delegation on Twitter interaction volume. Our findings narrate an intriguing story; while party affiliation and chamber of service do not
significantly influence interaction volume, the size of the state delegation emerges as a prominent, albeit not the only, determinant of interaction
volume \cite{Walraven2009AMO,Anderson2017SocialMS}. This underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of Twitter interactions among Congress
members, transcending the traditional party lines, and chamber divisions.

\section{Discussion}

This study tackled the influence of individual attributes on Twitter interaction volume among U.S. Congress members, a topic relevant and important in
the realm of political communication on social media \cite{Ausserhofer2013NATIONALPO, Stier2018ElectionCO, Jungherr2016TwitterUI}. Utilizing a robust
dataset detailing Twitter interactions of the 117th U.S. Congress along with attributes like party affiliation, chamber of service, and representative
state, we performed specialized analyses to highlight the factors significantly impacting interaction volume \cite{Hemphill2013WhatsCD,
Peng2016FollowerFolloweeNC}.

Our results contrast with prior research emphasizing the influence of party affiliation and political beliefs in shaping Twitter exchanges among
politicians \cite{Theocharis2020TheDO, Lu2019TheEO}. Our analysis revealed an unexpected lack of correlation between party affiliation and Twitter
interaction volume. Additionally, serving chamber did not show a strong effect either, in line with some studies \cite{Pablo2014TowardAE,
Henn2014SocialDI}, but in variance to others \cite{Chen2012WhyYA, Hu2015PredictingUE}. These divergences may be attributed to the differences in
datasets, time periods, setting, and the methods employed.

However, the size of the represented state's delegation surfaced as a significant determinant of interaction volume. This finding substantiates the
role of geographic factors noted by several prior studies \cite{Pablo2014TowardAE, Henn2014SocialDI}, and accentuates the relevance of representation
size in determining communication dynamics on social media.

The results should be interpreted in the light of several limitations. First, the study is constrained by the dataset's duration and yearly range,
leaving interacting factors from different periods unaccounted for. The dynamics of Twitter interaction may evolve with time, influenced by political
events, changes in public sentiment, or platform modifications. Further, the study is based solely on public interactions on Twitter, possibly
overlooking other communication dynamics happening in private or via other platforms.

In conclusion, our results highlight that Twitter interactions among U.S. Congress members are more strongly impacted by the size of state
representation than party affiliation or chamber of service. This finding provides a nuanced understanding of the factors driving communication in
political spaces on social media, suggesting a necessity to transcend traditional party lines and chamber divisions in the analysis. The results
stimulate interesting questions for further research, such as how the observed dynamics evolve over time and what the underlying motivation might be
for Congress members to engage at higher volumes with larger state delegations.

\section{Discussion}

Our study illuminates the complex dynamics of Twitter interactions among U.S. Congress members, an increasingly integral facet of political
communication \cite{Ausserhofer2013NATIONALPO, Stier2018ElectionCO, Jungherr2016TwitterUI}. Drawing on a comprehensive dataset capturing Twitter
interactions of the 117th U.S. Congress members and their corresponding affiliations and chambers of service, we set out to unravel the factors
prominently affecting interaction volumes \cite{Hemphill2013WhatsCD, Peng2016FollowerFolloweeNC}.

Compared to existing literature that underscores ideological and political conviction as key drivers of Twitter exchanges \cite{Theocharis2020TheDO,
Lu2019TheEO}, our study uncovers an unexpected narrative. While the party affiliation and chamber of service are traditionally vital components of
political organization, they surprisingly did not present a significant correlation with Twitter interaction volumes \cite{Chen2012WhyYA,
Hu2015PredictingUE}. This divergence from established literature may be attributed to transforming digital communication dynamics, evolution of
political strategies, and the specific time frame and context our dataset encapsulates.

On the other hand, the delegation size from respective states emerged as a significant predictor of Twitter interaction volumes. This finding broadens
the discourse beyond common political divisions, offering fresh perspectives on the role of geographic representation in digital political
communication \cite{Pablo2014TowardAE, Henn2014SocialDI}. However, the precise causal mechanisms connecting delegation size and interaction volumes
remain unclear and warrant further inquiry. Our stringent analysis methods and robust dataset shed light on the complex interplay of factors in
political digital communication, yet also impose some limitations.

The study is circumscribed by the dataset's duration, scope, and the data collection process, which could introduce selectiveness and other biases.
Dynamics of Twitter interactions may evolve over time, with varying influences from political events, public sentiment shifts, or platform-specific
modifications. Also, important confounding factors, such as the individual representative's influence, outreach, or engagement strategy, are not
accounted for in the dataset. Furthermore, our study focuses solely on public Twitter interactions; private dialogues and conversations exchanged on
other platforms remain undiscovered.

The observed correlation between the state delegation size and Twitter interactions yields interesting implications. Larger delegations may increase
cross-communication among members due to enhanced diversity and complexity in political discourse. The interaction volume might also reflect strategic
communicative behaviors designed to garner more recognition or publicity. These conjectures place a new lens on political strategy formulation and
underscore the importance of contextual factors in shaping digital political communication.

Looking forward, our results call for more detailed and extensive research exploring the precise drivers that associate state representation size with
Twitter interaction volume. Understanding these underlying mechanisms can provide a granular understanding of political communication in the digital
age. Furthermore, extending the temporal and platform range examined could offset the dataset limitations and yield a comprehensive understanding of
political discourse dynamics on social media.
