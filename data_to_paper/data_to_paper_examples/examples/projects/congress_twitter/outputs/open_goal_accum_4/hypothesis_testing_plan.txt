Here is our Hypothesis Testing Plan:

Hypothesis: Members from states with a higher number of representatives engage in a greater number of Twitter interactions
Statistical Test: ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the mean/median number of interactions across different states, adjusting for confounding variables such as Party and Chamber.

Hypothesis: Congress members from larger states with more representatives have a higher level of engagement diversity (measured by the number of unique interactions) compared to smaller states
Statistical Test: ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the mean/median number of unique interactions across different states, adjusting for confounding variables such as Party and Chamber.

Hypothesis: The relationship between state population size and engagement level on Twitter follows a linear or non-linear pattern
Statistical Test: Pearson's correlation or Spearman's correlation to examine the association between State population size and the number of Twitter interactions, adjusting for confounding variables such as Party and Chamber.
