Here is our Research Goal


Research Goal: 
To examine the influence of state representation size on the volume of Twitter interactions among members of the 117th US Congress.

Hypothesis: 
Congress members representing states with a larger number of representatives (indicative of larger population sizes) will have a higher volume of Twitter interactions compared to those from states with fewer representatives. This may be due to increased constituent engagement and a larger scope for public political discussion.


Here is our Hypothesis Testing Plan:

Hypothesis: The volume of Twitter interactions is higher for Congress members representing states with a larger number of representatives
Statistical Test: One-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc tests (e.g., Tukey's HSD) to assess differences in the volume of Twitter interactions across states, adjusting for political party and chamber as covariates.
