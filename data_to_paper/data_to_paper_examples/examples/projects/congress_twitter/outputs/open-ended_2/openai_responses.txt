The code aims to analyze and summarize the dataset by extracting various information and writing it to the \"data_exploration.txt\" file.\n\nFirst, the code reads the \"congress_members.csv\" file using pandas, which contains information about Congress members such as their Twitter handles, represented states, party affiliations, and chambers. The code then gathers data size information, including the number of members and the number of columns in the members' data.\n\nNext, the code calculates and adds information about the interaction network by reading the \"congress_edges.dat\" file using networkx. It analyzes the number of edges and nodes in the network.\n\nMoving on, the code collects summary statistics of the categorical variables in the members' data and writes them to the output file. It provides information like the most common value for each categorical variable (e.g., the most common represented state, party affiliation, and chamber).\n\nFurthermore, the code calculates the total number of missing values in the members' data and includes it in the output file. This provides an overview of the data quality and the extent of missing information.\n\nFinally, all the gathered information is written to the \"data_exploration.txt\" file. The file includes sections such as data size, summary statistics, categorical variables, and missing values. This allows for a comprehensive understanding and analysis of the US Congress Twitter dataset.\n\nThe output file serves as a summary and reference for the exploratory analysis of the dataset. It provides key details and statistical information that can aid in further research, data preprocessing, and decision-making processes.\n```\n",

    "- The hypothesis states that \"density and centrality of interactions within the Twitter-based network vary by Chamber and State, which influences the breadth and depth of legislative connectivity\". However, it is crucial to note that legislative connectivity cannot be inferred directly from the dataset.

    "(1) Relevant Statistical Issues:\n- Multiple Comparisons: Since we are testing multiple hypotheses, there is a potential issue of multiple comparisons. We need to account for this to avoid inflating the type I error rate.\n- Confounding Variables: There may be confounding variables that could influence the relationship between Chamber/State and Twitter interactions. We should consider adjusting for these variables to control for their potential effects.\n- Dependencies between Data Points: The Twitter interactions among Congress members can have dependencies, as certain members might have higher overall engagement or influence, which could impact their interactions with others. We need to consider these dependencies and choose appropriate statistical tests that account for them.\n- Missing Data Points: There are no missing data points in the provided dataset. However, if missing data were present, appropriate techniques such as imputation or exclusion should be applied.\n- Other Relevant Statistical Issues: We should also consider the potential presence of outliers, homoscedasticity, and normality assumptions when selecting and implementing statistical tests.\n\n(2) Statistical Test Suggestions:\n\nHypothesis 1: The density of interactions within the network varies by Chamber.\n\nStatistical Test: One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n- Dependent Variable: Density of interactions. \n- Independent Variable: Chamber (House, Senate).\n- Assumptions: The dependent variable follows a normal distribution, homogeneity of variances, and independence of observations.\n- Control Variables: None specified.\n\nHypothesis 2: The density of interactions within the network varies by State.\n\nStatistical Test: One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n- Dependent Variable: Density of interactions. \n- Independent Variable: State.\n- Assumptions: The dependent variable follows a normal distribution, homogeneity of variances, and independence of observations.\n- Control Variables: None specified.\n\nHypothesis 3: The centrality of interactions within the network varies by Chamber.\n\nStatistical Test: Kruskal-Wallis test.\n- Dependent Variable: Centrality measure (e.g., degree centrality, betweenness centrality).\n- Independent Variable: Chamber (House, Senate).\n- Assumptions: The dependent variable is not required to follow a specific distribution and assumes independence between groups.\n- Control Variables: None specified.\n\nHypothesis 4: The centrality of interactions within the network varies by State.\n\nStatistical Test: Kruskal-Wallis test.\n- Dependent Variable: Centrality measure (e.g., degree centrality, betweenness centrality).\n- Independent Variable: State.\n- Assumptions: The dependent variable is not required to follow a specific distribution and assumes independence between groups.\n- Control Variables: None specified.\n\nPlease note that these are general suggestions for statistical tests based on the provided hypotheses.

Understanding the dynamics of these interactions is crucial for uncovering the underlying political relationships and information flows within the legislative body. However, there is a research gap regarding the structural properties of this network and the factors influencing the interactions. \n\nTo address this gap, we construct a dataset of Twitter interactions among members of the 117th US Congress, spanning a 4-month period. The dataset encompasses the social connections between Congress members and includes attributes such as represented state, political party, and chamber. We analyze the network using graph metrics and statistical tests to reveal insightful patterns and dynamics.\n\nOur findings highlight several key results. Firstly, we find no statistically significant association between chamber affiliation and the density of out-degree interactions, indicating that both House and Senate members engage similarly in Twitter interactions. Additionally, we observe variations in the degree centrality across political parties, suggesting differences in the extent of Twitter engagement among Democrats, Republicans, and Independents.\n\nThese results contribute to the understanding of the social dynamics within Congress, showcasing the potential of directed graph analysis in studying political networks. However, it is important to note that our analysis is limited to Twitter interactions and does not capture the full spectrum of congressional communication. Nevertheless, the implications of this study extend to enhancing our knowledge of the role of social media in political discourse and decision-making processes.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n```",

The analysis focused on exploring the structural properties of the network and investigating the factors influencing these interactions.\n\nFirst, to understand the relationship between chamber affiliation and the density of out-degree interactions, we performed an analysis using an ANOVA test \\ref{table:anova_1}. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the density of out-degree interactions between the House and Senate (F statistic = 0.657, p-value = 0.418). This suggests that members of both chambers have similar engagement patterns when it comes to interacting with other members on Twitter.\n\nNext, to examine the degree centrality among political parties, we computed the average degree centrality for each party \\ref{table:degree_centrality_party}. The analysis revealed variations in the level of Twitter engagement among different political parties. The average degree centrality for Democrats was 0.117, for Independents was 0.0717, and for Republicans was 0.119. These results indicate that Democrats and Republicans have slightly higher levels of engagement on Twitter compared to Independents.\n\nTo summarize, the analysis of the US Congress Twitter interactions revealed interesting insights into the network structure and the factors influencing these interactions. The analysis did not find a significant difference in the density of out-degree interactions between the House and Senate, suggesting similar engagement patterns across chambers. However, variations in the average degree centrality among political parties were observed, indicating different levels of Twitter engagement among Democrats, Republicans, and Independents.\n\nOverall, these findings contribute to our understanding of the social dynamics within the US Congress and highlight the potential of directed graph analysis in studying political networks.

    "```latex\n\\section{Results}\n\nIn this study, we present the results of a comprehensive analysis conducted on a directed graph mapping the Twitter interactions among members of the 117th US Congress. Consisting of 475 nodes and 13289 edges, and exhibiting a density of 0.05902, the network generated offers deep insights into the structural properties and factors driving these interactions.\n\nOur first step involved investigating the connection between a member's house affiliation (House or Senate) and their out-degree interaction density. The generate a thorough understanding of the patterns in interaction density across different houses, we adopted an analysis of variance (ANOVA) approach, the details and results of which are presented in Table \\ref{table:anova_1}. The ANOVA results revealed a significant lack of difference in the density of out-degree interactions exhibited by members of the House or the Senate (F statistic = 0.657, p-value > 0.05). These findings suggest that the engagement patterns on Twitter among the congressional members remains unaffected by their house affiliations. In other words, the extent of connectivity or interaction between any given member and all other members does not vary significantly across the two houses.\n\nExpanding on these findings, our analysis then shifted focus onto studying the degree of centrality within each political party. The aim was to unearth underlying variations in Twitter engagement patterns among Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. As displayed in Table \\ref{table:degree_centrality_party}, our computations revealed an average degree centrality of 0.117 for Democrats, 0.0717 for Independents, and 0.119 for Republicans. These figures highlight slightly higher levels of engagement on Twitter by Democrats and Republicans compared to Independents. As degree centrality reflects the fraction of the graph that a node is connected to, these results represent a more extensive network of interactions pertaining to Democrats and Republicans.\n\nOverall, this analytical study based on the Twitter interactions among the members of the 117th US Congress has brought forth intriguing insights into the interconnected political network that forms part of the legislative body. Although there was no discernible difference in interaction density driven by house affiliations, evident variations in degree centrality among the different political parties were detected. Being solely reliant on Twitter interactions for the analysis might present a limitation in terms of capturing the full spectrum of congressional communication, but the insights garnered pave the way for future, expansive investigations within the politico-social dynamic sphere.\n```",
