Here is our Research Goal


Research Goal: 
Examine the impact of Twitter interactions on the formation of homophilous subgroups in the US Congress, specifically regarding members' Party and Chamber. 

Hypothesis: 
The homophily of Twitter engagement, with respect to members' Party and Chamber affiliations, impacts the structural properties of the interaction network. We expect to observe that members belonging to the same Party and/or Chamber, form cohesive subgroups within the network, and these subgroups display different degree distributions and centrality measures than expected under random mixing.


Here is our Hypothesis Testing Plan:

Hypothesis: The homophily of Twitter engagement, with respect to members' Party and Chamber affiliations, impacts the structural properties of the interaction network.
Statistical Test: Permutation test to compare the observed network metrics (e.g., degree distribution, clustering coefficient, modularity) with the null model generated by shuffling the Party and Chamber affiliations while preserving the network structure. This should account for dependencies between data points and allow us to assess the impact of homophily on the network structure.
