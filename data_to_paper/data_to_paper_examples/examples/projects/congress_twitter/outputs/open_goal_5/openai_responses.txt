    "\\section{Code Explanation}\nThe provided code performs data exploration on a dataset consisting of Twitter interactions among members of the 117th US Congress. \n\nFirst, the code loads the dataset files, 'congress_members.csv' and 'congress_edges.dat', which contain information about the members of Congress and the edges representing their Twitter interactions, respectively.\n\nThe code then calculates the number of nodes (Congress members) and edges (Twitter interactions) in the network using the NetworkX library.\n\nNext, the code analyzes the categorical variables in the 'congress_members' dataset, specifically the 'State', 'Party', and 'Chamber' attributes. It counts the occurrences of each unique value in these variables and stores the results in the 'state_counts', 'party_counts', and 'chamber_counts' variables, respectively.\n\nThe code also checks for missing values in the 'congress_members' dataset by using the 'isnull().sum()' function. The results are stored in the 'missing_values' variable.\n\nFinally, all the calculated statistics and summary information are written to the 'data_exploration.txt' file. The file includes details such as the number of nodes and edges in the network, the total number of Congress members, the counts of unique values for the categorical variables, and the number of missing values in the dataset.\n\nThe 'data_exploration.txt' file serves as a summary report for the data exploration phase, providing key information about the dataset's structure, characteristics of the Congress members, and the overall network of Twitter interactions.",
    "```latex\n\\section{Code Explanation}\n\nThe given code performs data exploration on a dataset that represents the Twitter interactions among members of the 117th US Congress. \n\nFirst, the code loads two data files: \"congress_members.csv\" which contains information about the Congress members including their Twitter handles, represented state, party affiliation, and chamber; and \"congress_edges.dat\" which represents the directed graph of Twitter interactions between Congress members.\n\nThe code then calculates the number of nodes and edges in the interaction network, providing an overview of the size and structure of the network.\n\nNext, the code analyzes categorical variables from the \"congress_members.csv\" file. It counts the number of Congress members from each state, party affiliation, and chamber, allowing us to understand the distribution of members across these categories.\n\nFurthermore, the code checks for missing values in the dataset and reports the count of missing values for each attribute.\n\nFinally, the code writes the results of the data exploration into a file called \"data_exploration.txt\". This file contains the following information: \n- Number of nodes and edges in the interaction network\n- Summary statistics such as the total number of Congress members\n- Counts of Congress members from each state, party affiliation, and chamber\n- Count of missing values for each attribute in the dataset.\n\nThe \"data_exploration.txt\" file serves as a comprehensive summary of the dataset, providing important insights into the structure and characteristics of the Twitter interactions among members of the 117th US Congress.\n\n```\n",
    "```\nResearch Goal: \nTo explore the collaborative behaviours between members of the US Congress, with the aim to identify unique collaborative patterns that are prominent within the Twitter interactions of Congress members across different States, Parties, and Chambers.\n\nHypothesis: \nDespite Party, State, or Chamber representation, unique collaborative patterns will emerge within the Twitter interactions, which may identify subsets of Congress members who regularly engage with each other, providing an indication of collaborative efforts that extend beyond formal categorizations.\n```",
    "The research goal is interesting, addressing patterns of collaboration, however the hypothesis is fairly broad and needs to be more specific. \n\nHere are my suggestions for improvement:\n* Although the hypothesis is on interaction patterns, it is not clear what constitutes as a \"unique collaborative pattern\". Thus, it would be beneficial to define what characteristics constitute such a pattern within the context of the data. \n* Because interactions are directional within the dataset, you could consider focusing on whether patterns of directionality give rise to unique communication networks within the Congress members. \n\nModified research hypothesis could be:\n\n```\nHypothesis: \nUnique collaborative patterns observed as defined by a measure of interaction density and directionality, will identify subsets of Congress members who regularly engage with each other on Twitter, regardless of their State, Party, or Chamber representation.\n```",

    "(1)\nPotential similarities:\n\n- Like Pang2016 and Barber2019, we are interested in understanding the communication networks and voting behaviors among the members of the US Congress on social media, particularly Twitter.\n- Hemphill2013 and Willis2015 are also concerned with tracking interactions and examining influence in the Twitter sphere, similar to the aim of identifying communication networks in our study.\n- Birdsey2015 proposes a topic pervasiveness model to capture the frequency and form of communication about a particular topic which can be paralleled to the directionality and density of interactions in our hypothesis.\n\n(2)\nDistinct aspects:\n\n- Unlike Pang2016 and Barber2019, we are not focusing directly on the voting behaviors or agenda setting but rather the generic collaborative behaviour and communication networks irrespective of their affiliations.\n- We are focusing more on the Collaborative behaviours between congress members while Hemphill2013 is more focused on the use of hashtags to frame political issues.\n- Our study is specifically focusing on U.S. Congress's Twitter interactions in a meaningful period of time, whereas Willis2015 focuses on global circumstances during the London Olympics.\n\n(3)\nGiven the assessment above, my recommendation is:\n\n{'choice': 'REVISE'}\n\nEven though we aim to explore the communication behaviours, there is a need to narrow down the focus a bit more to make it unique from existing literature. We can incorporate certain aspects like the effect of important topical events or issues pertaining during that period on the communication networks, not just simply mapping the interactions.  Adding some sort of predictive component, such as trying to predict future collaborative behaviours based on present interactions, might also lend novelty to our hypothesis.",

    "(1) Relevant statistical issues:\n\n- Multiple comparisons: Since we have multiple Congress members in our dataset and we are testing the interaction patterns among them, there is a potential for multiple comparisons. We should account for this issue by adjusting the significance level or using appropriate methods such as Bonferroni correction.\n\n- Confounding variables: We have several variables available in the dataset that we can use as adjustment variables to account for potential confounding. These variables include Represented State, Political Party, and Chamber. We should consider adjusting for these variables in our statistical analysis to control for their potential influence on the interaction dynamics.\n\n- Dependencies between data points: The Twitter interactions between Congress members form a network structure, where the interactions are dependent on the nodes and edges of the network. We should account for these dependencies in our statistical analysis to avoid violating the assumption of independence between data points. We can utilize network analysis methods and statistical models that take into account the network structure.\n\n- Missing data points: The data exploration code provided does not indicate any missing values in the dataset. However, it is important to handle missing data appropriately if they are present in any subsequent analysis. This may involve imputation methods or using statistical models that can handle missing data.\n\n- Other relevant statistical issues: Given the hierarchical nature of the interaction dynamics we want to analyze, it may be important to consider methods that capture the hierarchical structure, such as multilevel modeling or measures of centrality within the network.\n\n(2) Statistical test suggestions:\n\nBased on the specified hypotheses, the following statistical tests can be used:\n\nHypothesis: Significant asymmetrical interaction patterns could be identified within the U.S. Congress members' Twitter network, suggesting hierarchical positionality that may defeat traditional lines of Party, State, or Chamber affiliations. We posit that certain members with consistent higher engagement levels may emerge as key influencers within the network.\n\nStatistical Test: Network Centrality Analysis\n- Calculate centrality measures such as degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality for each Congress member.\n- Assess if certain members have significantly higher centrality values, indicating higher engagement levels and potential key influence within the network.\n- Account for multiple comparisons by using appropriate significance level adjustment methods, such as Bonferroni correction.\n\nHypothesis: The interaction dynamics among U.S. Congress members exhibit asymmetry, suggesting a hierarchical structure that is independent of Party, State, and Chamber affiliations.\n\nStatistical Test: Stochastic Block Model (SBM) Analysis\n- Apply the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to the Twitter interaction network of U.S. Congress members.\n- The SBM partitions the network into blocks/groups based on the patterns of interactions.\n- Assess if the identified blocks/groups exhibit significant asymmetry, indicating a hierarchical structure independent of Party, State, and Chamber affiliations.\n- Account for network dependencies and adjust for confounding variables by incorporating covariates in the SBM analysis.\n\nHypothesis: Certain Congress members with consistent higher engagement levels on Twitter may act as key influencers within the network, regardless of Party, State, or Chamber affiliations.\n\nStatistical Test: Logistic Regression\n- Create a binary outcome variable indicating whether a Congress member is a key influencer or not, based on a predetermined threshold of engagement level.\n- Use logistic regression to model the relationship between Party, State, Chamber affiliations, and the likelihood of being a key influencer, adjusting for confounding variables.\n- Assess the significance of the coefficients to determine if certain affiliations are associated with a higher likelihood of being a key influencer.\n\nHypothesis: The asymmetrical interaction patterns within the U.S. Congress members' Twitter network cannot be solely explained by Party, State, and Chamber affiliations.\n\nStatistical Test: Chi-squared Test of Independence\n- Perform a chi-squared test of independence between the Party, State, and Chamber affiliations and the presence/absence of an asymmetrical interaction pattern.\n- The chi-squared test will assess if there is a significant association between the variables, suggesting that Party, State, and Chamber affiliations are not the sole drivers of the interaction patterns.\n\nThe statistical test suggestions are not exhaustive, and alternative methods can also be considered based on specific requirements and assumptions. It is recommended to consult with a statistician or conduct further exploratory data analysis to determine the most appropriate statistical tests for each hypothesis.",
