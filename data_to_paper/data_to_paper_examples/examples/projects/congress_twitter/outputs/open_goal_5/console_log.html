</span><span class="ansi32">Description of the Dataset:

* Rationale:
The dataset maps US Congress's Twitter interactions into a directed graph with social interactions (edges) among Congress members (nodes). Each member
(node) is further characterized by three attributes: Represented State, Political Party, and Chamber, allowing analysis of the adjacency matrix
structure, graph metrics and likelihood of interactions across these attributes.

* Data Collection and Network Construction:
Twitter data of members of the 117th US Congress, from both the House and the Senate, were harvested for a 4-month period, February 9 to June 9, 2022
(using the Twitter API). Members with fewer than 100 tweets were excluded from the network.

- `Nodes`. Nodes represent Congress members. Each node is designated an integer node ID (0, 1, 2, ...) which corresponds to a row in
`congress_members.csv`, providing the member's Represented State, Political Party, and Chamber.

- `Edges`. A directed edge from node i to node j indicates that member i engaged with member j on Twitter at least once during the 4-month data-
collection period. An engagement is defined as a tweet by member i that mentions member j's handle, or as retweets, quote tweets, or replies of i to a
tweet by member j.
* Data analysis guidelines:
- Your analysis code should NOT create tables that include names of Congress members, or their Twitter handles.
- Your analysis code should NOT create tables that include names of States, or their two-letter abbreviations. The code may of course do statistical
analysis of *properties* related to States, but should not single out specific states.
2 data files:
File #1: "congress_members.csv"
A csv file of members of the 117th Congress, including their Twitter handles, Represented State, Party, and Chamber.
Data source: `https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/members-official-twitter-handles`.
Rows are ordered according to the node ID, starting at 0.

Fields:

`Handle`: Twitter handle (without `@`)
`State`: Categorical; Two-letter state abbreviation; including also: "DC", "PR", "VI", "AS", "GU", "MP".
`Party`: Categorical; Party affiliation ("D", "R", or "I")
`Chamber`: Categorical; The member's chamber ("House", "Senate")
Here are the first few lines of the file:
</span><span class="ansi92">```output
Handle,State,Party,Chamber
SenatorBaldwin,WI,D,Senate
SenJohnBarrasso,WY,R,Senate
SenatorBennet,CO,D,Senate

```</span><span class="ansi32">

File #2: "congress_edges.dat"
This file provides the interaction network between members of the 115th US Congress on Twitter.
Download and adapted from: `https://snap.stanford.edu/data/congress-twitter`

Each line contains two integers (i, j), indicating a directed edge from node ID i to node ID j, compatible with nx.read_edgelist('congress_edges.dat',
create_using=nx.DiGraph()). An i-&gt;j edge indicates that Congress member i had at least one tweet engaging with Congress member j during the 4-month
collection period.</span>

</span><span class="ansi32">As part of a data-exploration phase, please write a complete short Python code for getting a first sense of the data.

Your code should create an output text file named "data_exploration.txt", which should contain a summary of the data.

The output file should be self-contained; any results you choose to save to this file should be accompanied with a short header.

The output file should be formatted as follows:

</span><span class="ansi92">```output
# Data Size
&lt;Measure of the scale of our data (e.g., number of rows, number of columns)&gt;

# Summary Statistics
&lt;Summary statistics of all or key variables&gt;

# Categorical Variables
&lt;As applicable, list here categorical values and their most common values&gt;

# Missing Values
&lt;Counts of missing, unknown, or undefined values&gt;
&lt;As applicable, counts of special numeric values that stand for unknown/undefined if any (check in the "Description of the Dataset" above for any)&gt;

# &lt;other summary you deem relevant, if any&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;
```</span><span class="ansi32">

If needed, you can use the following packages which are already installed:
('pandas', 'numpy', 'scipy', 'networkx')

Do not provide a sketch or pseudocode; write a complete runnable code.
Do not create any graphics, figures or any plots.
Do not send any presumed output examples.</span>

The following script will read the files congress_members.csv and congress_edges.dat, calculate some basic statistics about the network and statistics
about the categorical variables State, Party, Chamber, and then write these statistics to a file.

This code uses the pandas library for reading and manipulating the CSV data, the networkx library for handling the interaction network data, and the
built-in Python file handling functions to write the output.

This script is meant to be run from the command line, and will write its output to a file called data_exploration.txt in the same directory. The
script assumes that the data files congress_members.csv and congress_edges.dat are also located in the same directory. Please adjust the paths to the
files as necessary for your environment.

**Ensure that the data files are in the same directory as this script or modify the path in the script to point to the correct location of your files.
Also, ensure that proper permissions exist for this script to read the data files and to write the output file in the specified directory.</span>

Please follow these two steps:

(1) Check the code and the output for any issues, and return a bullet-point response addressing these points:
* Are there any unexpected NaN values in the output.
* Can results be understood from the output file? In particular, do we have a short label for each result?
* Are there any results that are missing. Check that under each header in the output file there is a corresponding meaningful result.
* Any other issues you find.

(2) Based on your assessment above, return a Python Dict[str, str] mapping the issues you have noted above (dict keys) to specific suggested
corrections/improvements in the code (dict values).

For example:
</span><span class="ansi38-15">{</span>
<span class="ansi38-15"> </span><span class="ansi38-186">"</span><span class="ansi38-186">The result of the average of variable ... is missing</span><span class="ansi38-186">"</span><span class="ansi38-15">:</span><span class="ansi38-15"> </span><span class="ansi38-186">"</span><span class="ansi38-186">Add the missing calculation of ... to the code.</span><span class="ansi38-186">"</span><span class="ansi38-15">,</span>
<span class="ansi38-15"> </span><span class="ansi38-186">"</span><span class="ansi38-186">The average of the variable &lt;xxx&gt; is `Nan`</span><span class="ansi38-186">"</span><span class="ansi38-15">:</span><span class="ansi38-15"> </span><span class="ansi38-186">"</span><span class="ansi38-186">Remove missing values in the calculation.</span><span class="ansi38-186">"</span>
<span class="ansi38-15">}</span>
<span class="ansi32">

Try to be as specific as possible when describing the issues and proposed fixes.
Include in the dict as many issues as you find.
If there are no issues, and the code and tables are just perfect and need no corrections or enhancements, then return an empty dict:
</span><span class="ansi38-15">{</span><span class="ansi38-15">}</span>
<span class="ansi32">

Important:
* Do not return the revised code, only the issues and suggested fixes.
* If there are no critical issues, then return an empty dict: `{}`.
* Do not create positive issues that require no change in the code. In particular, do not write {"No issues found": "No corrections or improvements
are needed."}, return an empty dict instead.</span>

Based on the output file, the code seems to be working as expected. Here is my assessment:

* There are no unexpected NaN values in the output. The missing values section correctly reports that there are no missing values in the dataset.
* The results can be understood from the output file. Each result is preceded by a short label that describes what the result represents.
* There are no results that are missing. Under each header in the output file, there is a corresponding meaningful result.
* I did not find any other issues.

Therefore, my response is an empty dictionary:

</span><span class="ansi32">DESCRIPTION OF THE ORIGINAL DATASET

* Rationale:
The dataset maps US Congress's Twitter interactions into a directed graph with social interactions (edges) among Congress members (nodes). Each member
(node) is further characterized by three attributes: Represented State, Political Party, and Chamber, allowing analysis of the adjacency matrix
structure, graph metrics and likelihood of interactions across these attributes.

* Data Collection and Network Construction:
Twitter data of members of the 117th US Congress, from both the House and the Senate, were harvested for a 4-month period, February 9 to June 9, 2022
(using the Twitter API). Members with fewer than 100 tweets were excluded from the network.

- `Nodes`. Nodes represent Congress members. Each node is designated an integer node ID (0, 1, 2, ...) which corresponds to a row in
`congress_members.csv`, providing the member's Represented State, Political Party, and Chamber.

- `Edges`. A directed edge from node i to node j indicates that member i engaged with member j on Twitter at least once during the 4-month data-
collection period. An engagement is defined as a tweet by member i that mentions member j's handle, or as retweets, quote tweets, or replies of i to a
tweet by member j.
* Data analysis guidelines:
- Your analysis code should NOT create tables that include names of Congress members, or their Twitter handles.
- Your analysis code should NOT create tables that include names of States, or their two-letter abbreviations. The code may of course do statistical
analysis of *properties* related to States, but should not single out specific states.
2 data files:
File #1: "congress_members.csv"
A csv file of members of the 117th Congress, including their Twitter handles, Represented State, Party, and Chamber.
Data source: `https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/members-official-twitter-handles`.
Rows are ordered according to the node ID, starting at 0.

Fields:

`Handle`: Twitter handle (without `@`)
`State`: Categorical; Two-letter state abbreviation; including also: "DC", "PR", "VI", "AS", "GU", "MP".
`Party`: Categorical; Party affiliation ("D", "R", or "I")
`Chamber`: Categorical; The member's chamber ("House", "Senate")
Here are the first few lines of the file:
</span><span class="ansi92">```output
Handle,State,Party,Chamber
SenatorBaldwin,WI,D,Senate
SenJohnBarrasso,WY,R,Senate
SenatorBennet,CO,D,Senate

```</span><span class="ansi32">

File #2: "congress_edges.dat"
This file provides the interaction network between members of the 115th US Congress on Twitter.
Download and adapted from: `https://snap.stanford.edu/data/congress-twitter`

Each line contains two integers (i, j), indicating a directed edge from node ID i to node ID j, compatible with nx.read_edgelist('congress_edges.dat',
create_using=nx.DiGraph()). An i-&gt;j edge indicates that Congress member i had at least one tweet engaging with Congress member j during the 4-month
collection period.</span>

\section{Code Explanation}
The provided code performs data exploration on a dataset consisting of Twitter interactions among members of the 117th US Congress.

First, the code loads the dataset files, 'congress_members.csv' and 'congress_edges.dat', which contain information about the members of Congress and
the edges representing their Twitter interactions, respectively.

The code then calculates the number of nodes (Congress members) and edges (Twitter interactions) in the network using the NetworkX library.

Next, the code analyzes the categorical variables in the 'congress_members' dataset, specifically the 'State', 'Party', and 'Chamber' attributes. It
counts the occurrences of each unique value in these variables and stores the results in the 'state_counts', 'party_counts', and 'chamber_counts'
variables, respectively.

The code also checks for missing values in the 'congress_members' dataset by using the 'isnull().sum()' function. The results are stored in the
'missing_values' variable.

Finally, all the calculated statistics and summary information are written to the 'data_exploration.txt' file. The file includes details such as the
number of nodes and edges in the network, the total number of Congress members, the counts of unique values for the categorical variables, and the
number of missing values in the dataset.

The 'data_exploration.txt' file serves as a summary report for the data exploration phase, providing key information about the dataset's structure,
characteristics of the Congress members, and the overall network of Twitter interactions.</span>

\section{Code Explanation}

The given code performs data exploration on a dataset that represents the Twitter interactions among members of the 117th US Congress.

First, the code loads two data files: "congress_members.csv" which contains information about the Congress members including their Twitter handles,
represented state, party affiliation, and chamber; and "congress_edges.dat" which represents the directed graph of Twitter interactions between
Congress members.

The code then calculates the number of nodes and edges in the interaction network, providing an overview of the size and structure of the network.

Next, the code analyzes categorical variables from the "congress_members.csv" file. It counts the number of Congress members from each state, party
affiliation, and chamber, allowing us to understand the distribution of members across these categories.

Furthermore, the code checks for missing values in the dataset and reports the count of missing values for each attribute.

Finally, the code writes the results of the data exploration into a file called "data_exploration.txt". This file contains the following information:
- Number of nodes and edges in the interaction network
- Summary statistics such as the total number of Congress members
- Counts of Congress members from each state, party affiliation, and chamber
- Count of missing values for each attribute in the dataset.

The "data_exploration.txt" file serves as a comprehensive summary of the dataset, providing important insights into the structure and characteristics
of the Twitter interactions among members of the 117th US Congress.

The research goal is interesting, addressing patterns of collaboration, however the hypothesis is fairly broad and needs to be more specific.

Here are my suggestions for improvement:
* Although the hypothesis is on interaction patterns, it is not clear what constitutes as a "unique collaborative pattern". Thus, it would be
beneficial to define what characteristics constitute such a pattern within the context of the data.
* Because interactions are directional within the dataset, you could consider focusing on whether patterns of directionality give rise to unique
communication networks within the Congress members.

Modified research hypothesis could be:

</span><span class="ansi96">```
Hypothesis:
Unique collaborative patterns observed as defined by a measure of interaction density and directionality, will identify subsets of Congress members
who regularly engage with each other on Twitter, regardless of their State, Party, or Chamber representation.

Thank you for your feedback. Here's the revised goal and hypothesis based on your suggestions:

</span><span class="ansi96">```
Research Goal:
To explore the collaborative behaviours between members of the US Congress, with a focus on unique communication networks that arise due to the
directional interactions on Twitter, irrespective of their States, Parties, and Chambers.

Hypothesis:
Unique communication networks, identified by a specific measure of interaction density and directionality, will emerge within the Twitter
interactions. These networks could reveal subsets of Congress members who frequently engage with each other on Twitter, demonstrating a layer of
collaboration beyond their State, Party, or Chamber affiliations.

</span><span class="ansi32">Here is our Research Goal
Research Goal:
To explore the collaborative behaviours between members of the US Congress, with a focus on unique communication networks that arise due to the
directional interactions on Twitter, irrespective of their States, Parties, and Chambers.

Hypothesis:
Unique communication networks, identified by a specific measure of interaction density and directionality, will emerge within the Twitter
interactions. These networks could reveal subsets of Congress members who frequently engage with each other on Twitter, demonstrating a layer of
collaboration beyond their State, Party, or Chamber affiliations.</span>

</span><span class="ansi36">

(1)
Potential similarities:

- Like Pang2016 and Barber2019, we are interested in understanding the communication networks and voting behaviors among the members of the US
Congress on social media, particularly Twitter.
- Hemphill2013 and Willis2015 are also concerned with tracking interactions and examining influence in the Twitter sphere, similar to the aim of
identifying communication networks in our study.
- Birdsey2015 proposes a topic pervasiveness model to capture the frequency and form of communication about a particular topic which can be paralleled
to the directionality and density of interactions in our hypothesis.

(2)
Distinct aspects:

- Unlike Pang2016 and Barber2019, we are not focusing directly on the voting behaviors or agenda setting but rather the generic collaborative
behaviour and communication networks irrespective of their affiliations.
- We are focusing more on the Collaborative behaviours between congress members while Hemphill2013 is more focused on the use of hashtags to frame
political issues.
- Our study is specifically focusing on U.S. Congress's Twitter interactions in a meaningful period of time, whereas Willis2015 focuses on global
circumstances during the London Olympics.

(3)
Given the assessment above, my recommendation is:

{'choice': 'REVISE'}

Even though we aim to explore the communication behaviours, there is a need to narrow down the focus a bit more to make it unique from existing
literature. We can incorporate certain aspects like the effect of important topical events or issues pertaining during that period on the
communication networks, not just simply mapping the interactions.  Adding some sort of predictive component, such as trying to predict future
collaborative behaviours based on present interactions, might also lend novelty to our hypothesis.</span>

</span><span class="ansi32">Based on the result of the literature search above, please revise, or completely re-write, the research goal and hypothesis that we have so that they
do not completely overlap existing literature.

Guidelines:

* Try to avoid trivial hypotheses (like just testing for simple linear associations).
Instead, you could perhaps explore more complex associations and relationships, like testing for moderation effects or interactions between variables.

* Make sure that your suggested hypothesis can be studied using only the provided dataset, without requiring any additional data. In particular, pay
attention to using only data available based on the provided headers of our data files (see "Description of the Original Dataset", above).

* Do not suggest methodology. Just the goal and an hypothesis.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR FORMATTING YOUR RESPONSE:
Please return the goal and hypothesis enclosed within triple-backticks, like this:

Research Goal:
Analyze the hierarchical interaction dynamics among U.S. Congress members on Twitter. Specifically, assess the asymmetry in Twitter interactions to
identify potential influencers and followers within this network, independently of their Party, State, and Chamber affiliations.

Hypothesis:
Significant asymmetrical interaction patterns could be identified within the U.S. Congress members' Twitter network, suggesting hierarchical
positionality that may defeat traditional lines of Party, State, or Chamber affiliations. We posit that certain members with consistent higher
engagement levels may emerge as key influencers within the network.

(1) Potential similarities between our goal and hypothesis, and the related papers listed above:

- Analysis of interaction dynamics on online platforms (Theocharis2020TheDO, Wei2017MeasuringSI, Khrabrov2010DiscoveringII, Jiang2016InferringLB).
- Use of network analysis and measures to analyze connections (Fowler2006ConnectingTC, Wei2017MeasuringSI, Khrabrov2010DiscoveringII,
Jiang2016InferringLB).
- Identification of influence or influential entities within the networks (Wei2017MeasuringSI, Khrabrov2010DiscoveringII).

(2) Ways our stated goal and hypothesis are distinct from the related papers listed above:

- Our research focus specifically falls on the U.S. Congress and the dynamics of their interactions on Twitter, as compared to the related papers that
explore various communities and different contexts (Theocharis2020TheDO studies the dynamics of incivility in political Twitter discourses,
Fowler2006ConnectingTC looks at cosponsorship networks in Congress, Wei2017MeasuringSI measures spatial influence on Twitter,
Khrabrov2010DiscoveringII and Jiang2016InferringLB analyze influence in general communication and social networks).
- We aim to assess the asymmetry in Twitter interactions and identify potential influencers and followers within this network, independent of their
Party, State, and Chamber affiliations. This is a uniquely specific, contextually-bound and attribute-sensitive approach that none of the existing
papers appears to adopt.

</span><span class="ansi32">We would like to test the specified hypotheses using the provided dataset.

Please follow these two steps:

(1) Return a bullet-point review of relevant statistical issues.
Read the "Description of the Original Dataset" and the "Data Exploration Code and Output" provided above, and then for each of the following generic
statistical issues determine if they are relevant for our case and whether they should be accounted for:
* multiple comparisons.
* confounding variables (see available variables in the dataset that we can adjust for).
* dependencies between data points.
* missing data points.
* any other relevant statistical issues.

(2) Create a Python Dict[str, str], mapping each hypothesis (dict key) to the statistical test that would be most adequate for testing it (dict
value).
The keys of this dictionary should briefly describe each of our hypotheses.
The values of this dictionary should specify the most adequate statistical test for each hypothesis, and describe how it should be performed while
accounting for any issues you have outlined above as relevant.

For each of our hypotheses, suggest a *single* statistical test.
If there are several possible ways to test a given hypothesis, specify only *one* statistical test (the simplest one).

Your response for this part should be formatted as a Python dictionary, like this:
</span><span class="ansi38-15">{</span>
<span class="ansi38-15"> </span><span class="ansi38-186">"</span><span class="ansi38-186">xxx is associated with yyy and zzz</span><span class="ansi38-186">"</span><span class="ansi38-15">:</span>
<span class="ansi38-15"> </span><span class="ansi38-186">"</span><span class="ansi38-186">linear regression with xxx as the independent variable and yyy and zzz as the dependent variables while adjusting for aaa, bbb, ccc</span><span class="ansi38-186">"</span><span class="ansi38-15">,</span>
<span class="ansi38-15"> </span><span class="ansi38-186">"</span><span class="ansi38-186">the association between xxx and yyy is moderated by zzz</span><span class="ansi38-186">"</span><span class="ansi38-15">:</span><span class="ansi38-15"> </span>
<span class="ansi38-15"> </span><span class="ansi38-186">"</span><span class="ansi38-186">repeat the above linear regression, while adding the interaction term between yyy and zzz</span><span class="ansi38-186">"</span><span class="ansi38-15">,</span>
<span class="ansi38-15">}</span>
<span class="ansi32">

These of course are just examples. Your actual response should be based on the goal and hypotheses that we have specified above (see the "Research
Goal" above).

Note how in the example shown the different hypotheses are connected to each other, building towards a single
study goal.

Remember to return a valid Python dictionary Dict[str, str].</span>

</span><span class="ansi36">

(1) Relevant statistical issues:

- Multiple comparisons: Since we have multiple Congress members in our dataset and we are testing the interaction patterns among them, there is a
potential for multiple comparisons. We should account for this issue by adjusting the significance level or using appropriate methods such as
Bonferroni correction.

- Confounding variables: We have several variables available in the dataset that we can use as adjustment variables to account for potential
confounding. These variables include Represented State, Political Party, and Chamber. We should consider adjusting for these variables in our
statistical analysis to control for their potential influence on the interaction dynamics.

- Dependencies between data points: The Twitter interactions between Congress members form a network structure, where the interactions are dependent
on the nodes and edges of the network. We should account for these dependencies in our statistical analysis to avoid violating the assumption of
independence between data points. We can utilize network analysis methods and statistical models that take into account the network structure.

- Missing data points: The data exploration code provided does not indicate any missing values in the dataset. However, it is important to handle
missing data appropriately if they are present in any subsequent analysis. This may involve imputation methods or using statistical models that can
handle missing data.

- Other relevant statistical issues: Given the hierarchical nature of the interaction dynamics we want to analyze, it may be important to consider
methods that capture the hierarchical structure, such as multilevel modeling or measures of centrality within the network.

(2) Statistical test suggestions:

Based on the specified hypotheses, the following statistical tests can be used:

Hypothesis: Significant asymmetrical interaction patterns could be identified within the U.S. Congress members' Twitter network, suggesting
hierarchical positionality that may defeat traditional lines of Party, State, or Chamber affiliations. We posit that certain members with consistent
higher engagement levels may emerge as key influencers within the network.

Statistical Test: Network Centrality Analysis
- Calculate centrality measures such as degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality for each Congress member.
- Assess if certain members have significantly higher centrality values, indicating higher engagement levels and potential key influence within the
network.
- Account for multiple comparisons by using appropriate significance level adjustment methods, such as Bonferroni correction.

Hypothesis: The interaction dynamics among U.S. Congress members exhibit asymmetry, suggesting a hierarchical structure that is independent of Party,
State, and Chamber affiliations.

Statistical Test: Stochastic Block Model (SBM) Analysis
- Apply the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to the Twitter interaction network of U.S. Congress members.
- The SBM partitions the network into blocks/groups based on the patterns of interactions.
- Assess if the identified blocks/groups exhibit significant asymmetry, indicating a hierarchical structure independent of Party, State, and Chamber
affiliations.
- Account for network dependencies and adjust for confounding variables by incorporating covariates in the SBM analysis.

Hypothesis: Certain Congress members with consistent higher engagement levels on Twitter may act as key influencers within the network, regardless of
Party, State, or Chamber affiliations.

Statistical Test: Logistic Regression
- Create a binary outcome variable indicating whether a Congress member is a key influencer or not, based on a predetermined threshold of engagement
level.
- Use logistic regression to model the relationship between Party, State, Chamber affiliations, and the likelihood of being a key influencer,
adjusting for confounding variables.
- Assess the significance of the coefficients to determine if certain affiliations are associated with a higher likelihood of being a key influencer.

Hypothesis: The asymmetrical interaction patterns within the U.S. Congress members' Twitter network cannot be solely explained by Party, State, and
Chamber affiliations.

Statistical Test: Chi-squared Test of Independence
- Perform a chi-squared test of independence between the Party, State, and Chamber affiliations and the presence/absence of an asymmetrical
interaction pattern.
- The chi-squared test will assess if there is a significant association between the variables, suggesting that Party, State, and Chamber affiliations
are not the sole drivers of the interaction patterns.

The statistical test suggestions are not exhaustive, and alternative methods can also be considered based on specific requirements and assumptions. It
is recommended to consult with a statistician or conduct further exploratory data analysis to determine the most appropriate statistical tests for
each hypothesis.</span>
