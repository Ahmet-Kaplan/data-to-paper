Here is our Research Goal


Research Goal: 
Analyze the influence of geographical location and chamber representation on network centrality measures among the congress members in the Twitter interaction network.

Hypothesis: 
The centrality measures in the Twitter interaction network vary based on the geographical location (state representation) and the chamber (House or Senate) of the congress members.


Here is our Hypothesis Testing Plan:

Hypothesis: The centrality measures in the Twitter interaction network vary based on the geographical location (state representation) of the congress members
Statistical Test: ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the centrality measures across different states, adjusting for potential confounding variables (e.g., party affiliation, chamber representation)

Hypothesis: The centrality measures in the Twitter interaction network vary based on the chamber (House or Senate) representation of the congress members
Statistical Test: Independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U test to compare the centrality measures between the House and Senate, adjusting for potential confounding variables (e.g., state representation, party affiliation)

Hypothesis: The influence of geographical location (state representation) on centrality measures is moderated by the chamber (House or Senate) representation of the congress members
Statistical Test: Multiple regression analysis with centrality measures as dependent variables, state representation and chamber representation as independent variables, and adjusting for potential confounding variables (e.g., party affiliation)
