Here is our Research Goal


Research Goal:
Investigate the structure of the Twitter interaction network of Congress members, particularly focusing on the distributions of incoming and outgoing interactions.

Hypothesis:
The distributions of in-degree and out-degree in the network exhibit properties of regular patterns found in real-world networks, such as power-law distribution. This suggests that few Congress members predominantly participate in or are subjects of discourse.


Here is our Hypothesis Testing Plan:

Hypothesis: The distributions of in-degree and out-degree in the network exhibit properties of regular patterns found in real-world networks, such as power-law distribution
Statistical Test: Perform a goodness-of-fit test, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test or the Chi-square test, between the observed degree distribution and a power-law distribution. Adjust for confounding variables, if necessary.
