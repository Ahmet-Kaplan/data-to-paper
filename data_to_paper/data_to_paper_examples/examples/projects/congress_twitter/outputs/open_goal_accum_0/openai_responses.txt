Loading the Datasets: \n   The code loads two datasets - \"congress_members.csv\" and \"congress_edges.dat\". The first dataset contains information about the members of the US Congress, including their Twitter handles, represented state, party affiliation, and chamber. The second dataset represents the interaction network between members on Twitter.\n\n2. Summary Statistics: \n   The code calculates summary statistics for the categorical variables in the \"congress_members.csv\" dataset. It provides information such as the count, unique values, and the most common value for each variable - State, Party, and Chamber. These statistics help understand the distribution and representation of members across different categories.\n\n3. Missing Values:\n   The code checks for missing values in the \"congress_members.csv\" dataset and calculates the count of missing values for each variable. This information helps identify if any data is missing and may require further data cleaning or imputation steps.\n\n4. Report Generation:\n   The code generates a report summarizing the data size, summary statistics, categorical variables, and missing values. The report is written into a file named \"data_exploration.txt\". The report provides insights into the overall dataset and its characteristics, helping researchers understand the data before further analysis.\n\n5. Network Data:\n   The code calculates the number of nodes (members) and edges (interactions) in the interaction network represented by the \"congress_edges.dat\" dataset. This information gives an overview of the network's size and complexity.\n\nThe \"data_exploration.txt\" file contains the generated report, which includes:\n- Data Size: Number of rows and columns in the \"congress_members.csv\" dataset.\n- Summary Statistics: Summary statistics for categorical variables - State, Party, and Chamber.\n- Categorical Variables: Most common values for State, Party, and Chamber.\n- Missing Values: Count of missing values for each variable.\n- Network Data: Number of nodes and edges in the interaction network dataset.\n\nThe \"data_exploration.txt\" file serves as a reference for researchers to understand the dataset's characteristics, summary statistics, and network data before performing further analysis.\n\n```\n",
    "```\nResearch Goal: \nTo examine the role of chamber (House or Senate) in shaping the interaction network within the 117th US Congress. \n\nHypothesis: \nMembers of the House of Representatives will have more interactions amongst themselves in the Twitter network, compared to the members of the Senate. This could potentially be due to the larger number of members in the House, which might result in a denser network of interactions amongst them.\n```",

    "(1) Potential similarities between our goal and hypothesis, and the related papers listed above:\n\n- Like Cinelli2021TheEC, our study is interested in examining network interactions through a specific platform, in our case, Twitter.\n- The study by Peng2016FollowerFolloweeNC examines the relationship between Twitter interactions among the US Congress members, similar to our research.\n- Like Gaumont2018ReconstructionOT, we aim to map the dynamics of political networks.\n- Gillani2018MeME also looks into political network interactions on Twitter, as we do in our research.\n\n(2) In what ways, if any, our stated goal and hypothesis are distinct from the related papers listed above:\n\n- Our focus given by chamber (House or Senate) is novel compared to these papers. We specifically aim to understand the role this variable plays in shaping the network which is not explicitly done in these papers.\n- While Twitter interactions among US Congress members have been studied, as in the case of Peng2016FollowerFolloweeNC, our hypothesis specifically targets the interaction dynamics based on their role in the House or Senate.\n\n(3) Given the assessment above, our goal and hypothesis offer novelty and a unique perspective because they are not covered extensively in the assisted papers.\n\n{'choice': 'OK'}\n",
    "(1) Review of relevant statistical issues:\n\n- Multiple comparisons: This issue is not relevant for the specified hypothesis as we are testing a single hypothesis regarding the role of the chamber in shaping the interaction network.\n- Confounding variables: We can adjust for the variables Party (political party affiliation) and State (represented state) to account for potential confounding effects in the analysis.\n- Dependencies between data points: Since the dataset represents a directed graph, there can be dependencies between data points. However, this is not a concern for the specified hypothesis as we are interested in the overall comparison of interactions between the House and Senate members.\n- Missing data points: The data exploration code indicates that there are no missing values in the provided dataset. Therefore, missing data is not a concern for the analysis.\n- Other relevant statistical issues: Based on the information provided, no other specific statistical issues seem to be relevant for testing the hypothesis.\n\n(2) Statistical tests for each hypothesis:\n\nHypothesis: Members of the House of Representatives will have more interactions amongst themselves in the Twitter network, compared to the members of the Senate.\n\nStatistical test: Chi-square test of independence.\n\nProcedure:\n1. Create a contingency table with the counts of interactions between House members, Senate members, and interactions between House and Senate members.\n2. Conduct a chi-square test of independence to determine if there is a significant association between the chamber (House or Senate) and the interactions in the network.\n3. Adjust for confounding variables (Party and State) in the chi-square test by incorporating them into the contingency table or using a chi-square test with appropriate degrees of freedom.\n\nPython dictionary:\n```python\n{\n \"Members of the House have more interactions amongst themselves compared to the Senate\":\n \"Chi-square test of independence, adjusting for confounding variables (Party and State)\",\n}\n```",

The analysis is performed in several steps:\n\n1. Load the dataset: The code reads the 'congress_members.csv' file, which contains information about the Congress members, and creates a directed graph object 'G' from the 'congress_edges.dat' file, which represents the Twitter interactions between the members.\n\n2. Dataset Preparations: The code converts the graph edges into a pandas DataFrame, allowing for easier manipulation and analysis. It also merges the DataFrame with the 'df_members' DataFrame to get additional details about the chambers of the source and target nodes.\n\n3. Descriptive Statistics: No descriptive statistics table is created in this analysis, so this step is skipped.\n\n4. Preprocessing: No preprocessing is performed on the data since it is already in a suitable format for analysis.\n\n5. Analysis:\n    a. Table 1: \"Distribution of interactions among House and Senate Members\": The code creates a contingency table using the 'crosstab' function to show the distribution of interactions between members of the House and the Senate. The resulting table is saved as 'table_1.pkl'.\n\n    b. Chi-Square Test of Independence: The code performs a chi-square test of independence on the contingency table created in the previous step using the 'chi2_contingency' function. It calculates the chi-square statistic, p-value, degrees of freedom, and expected frequencies. These results are saved as 'table_2.pkl'.\n\n6. Saving Additional Results: The code saves the total number of observations and the results of the chi-square test of independence as a dictionary in the 'additional_results.pkl' file. This file can be used to further analyze and interpret the results.\n\nOverall, the code performs an analysis on the Twitter interactions among members of the 117th US Congress, examining the distribution of interactions between the House and the Senate and conducting a chi-square test to determine if the interactions are independent of the chamber.

In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of Twitter interactions among members of the 117th US Congress. We construct a directed graph representing social connections among Congress members and explore the structure of the network using graph metrics and attributes such as represented state, political party, and chamber. The dataset spans a 4-month period and includes interactions via mentions, retweets, quote tweets, and replies. Our findings reveal the distribution of interactions among members of the House of Representatives and the Senate, providing insights into patterns of collaboration and communication. Additionally, a chi-square test of independence shows a significant relationship between the chambers, suggesting differentiated interaction patterns.

Understanding differentiated collaboration and communication patterns between these two chambers is essential for comprehending the dynamics of political communication and networked governance. By mapping the 4-month dataset of Twitter interactions, comprising 13,289 edges, we aimed to uncover patterns specific to each chamber.\n\nTable\\textasciitilde{}\\ref{table:distribution_of_interactions} provides an overview of the distribution of interactions between the House of Representatives and the Senate. Our analysis reveals a total of 10,115 interactions originating from the House of Representatives, with 472 directed towards the Senate.

    "```latex\n\\section{Results}\n\nTo gain a comprehensive understanding of the nature of interactions among the 117th U.S. Congress members, we examined a dataset comprising 13,289 directed edges, indicating Twitter interactions. This investigation was motivated by the need to understand how the communications between chambers might reflect the nature of legislative collaboration and provide insights into democratic processes in the context of digital platforms. \n\nInitially, we analyzed the interactions between two key chambers of the U.S. Congress \u2014 the House of Representatives and the Senate. The findings, presented in Table \\ref{table:distribution_of_interactions}, highlight a distinct pattern: interactions primarily occur within the same chamber rather than across chambers. Specifically, the House of Representatives recorded 10,115 interactions, a vast majority of which were internal, with only 472 interactions involving members of the Senate. The Senate, on the other hand, was involved in a total of 2,702 interactions, wherein approximately 58\\% of these interactions were directed towards the House of Representatives.\n\nSubsequently, to affirm the relevance of chambers in shaping the communication patterns, we performed a Chi-square test of independence, enabling us to ascertain if there is a significant independence between the source and target of an interaction. Our results, as delineated in Table \\ref{table:chi_square_result}, signify a Chi-square statistic of 4727 with a p-value less than 1e-6. This demonstrates a statistically significant lack of independence between the chamber of Congress members and their Twitter interactions.\n\nIn summary, the observed patterns in Twitter interactions among the members of the 117th U.S. Congress are significantly influenced by their respective chambers. Notably, interactions predominantly take place within the same chamber rather than between different chambers. The highly significant chi-square statistic further validates this non-random nature of Twitter interactions between the congress members. Consequently, these results shed light on the demarcation of communications within the contemporary U.S. Congress\u2013 an important aspect to consider when exploring online political dynamics and networked governance.\n```\n",

The motivation for this examination was to better comprehend the collaboration and communication patterns among the chambers due to their importance in political communication and networked governance. Our dataset consisted of 13,289 directed edges between the congress members, demonstrating their Twitter interaction patterns over a period of four months. \n\nWe first focused on the interactions between the House of Representatives and the Senate. The results illustrated in Table\\textasciitilde{}\\ref{table:distribution_of_interactions} showed 10,115 interactions initiated by the House of Representatives members, out of which a minor fraction, precisely 472, was directed towards the Senate. Meanwhile, the Senate members started 1,139 interactions, among which a comparably larger fraction, namely 1,563, was directed towards the House of Representatives. Such an evident disparity in the numbers suggested a clear difference in interaction patterns across the chambers.\n\nTo further quantify the observed interaction patterns, we conducted a chi-square test of independence, which measured if the interaction distribution across the chambers was purely by chance. As presented in Table\\textasciitilde{}\\ref{table:chi_square_result}, the chi-square statistic was significantly high, recording at 4727 with a p-value less than 1e-6. This clearly demonstrated that the distribution of interactions among the two chambers was not independent, and the chamber to which the congress members belonged did influence the way they interacted on Twitter.\n\nTo sum up, the analysis revealed distinct collaboration and communication patterns between the House of Representatives and the Senate. From the interaction frequency to the extent of influence the chamber had, our analysis indeed enriched our understanding of the networked dynamics of online political interactions among members of the 117th US Congress and offered insights into the evolving democratic processes in networked governance and political communication.\n```",
