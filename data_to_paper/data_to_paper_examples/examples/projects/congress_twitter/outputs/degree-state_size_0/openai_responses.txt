    "```latex\n\\section{Code Explanation}\nThe provided code performs data exploration on the given dataset of US Congress Twitter interactions. The code aims to analyze and summarize the dataset by extracting various information and writing it to the \"data_exploration.txt\" file.\n\nFirst, the code reads the \"congress_members.csv\" file using pandas, which contains information about Congress members such as their Twitter handles, represented states, party affiliations, and chambers. The code then gathers data size information, including the number of members and the number of columns in the members' data.\n\nNext, the code calculates and adds information about the interaction network by reading the \"congress_edges.dat\" file using networkx. It analyzes the number of edges and nodes in the network.\n\nMoving on, the code collects summary statistics of the categorical variables in the members' data and writes them to the output file. It provides information like the most common value for each categorical variable (e.g., the most common represented state, party affiliation, and chamber).\n\nFurthermore, the code calculates the total number of missing values in the members' data and includes it in the output file. This provides an overview of the data quality and the extent of missing information.\n\nFinally, all the gathered information is written to the \"data_exploration.txt\" file. The file includes sections such as data size, summary statistics, categorical variables, and missing values. This allows for a comprehensive understanding and analysis of the US Congress Twitter dataset.\n\nThe output file serves as a summary and reference for the exploratory analysis of the dataset. It provides key details and statistical information that can aid in further research, data preprocessing, and decision-making processes.\n```\n",

    "(1) Bullet-point review of relevant statistical issues:\n\n* Multiple Comparisons: Multiple comparisons may not be relevant in this case as we have specific hypotheses to test and we are suggesting a single statistical test for each hypothesis. However, if additional hypotheses are added or multiple statistical tests are conducted without adjusting for multiplicity, then the issue of multiple comparisons may arise.\n\n* Confounding Variables: Confounding variables should be accounted for to ensure that observed associations are not influenced by the presence of other variables. In this case, we have the variables Party and Chamber that can be adjusted for as potential confounders.\n\n* Dependencies between Data Points: Dependencies between data points may exist due to the social network structure of the data. Members who are connected in the network may have similar in-degree and out-degree values. This dependency should be accounted for when conducting statistical tests.\n\n* Missing Data Points: The data exploration code indicates that there are no missing values in the provided dataset. However, if missing data points are present, appropriate methods such as imputation or excluding cases with missing values should be used to handle them.\n\n* Other Relevant Statistical Issues: One relevant statistical issue to consider is the assumption of linearity in regression models when conducting linear regression analysis. If the relationship between variables is non-linear, alternative statistical models or transformations of variables may be needed.\n\n(2) Mapping each hypothesis to the most adequate statistical test:\n\n{\n \"The in-degree and out-degree of a member are associated with the size of their State (as measured by the number of members in each State), even when controlling for Party and Chamber\":\n \"Multiple Linear Regression with in-degree and out-degree as dependent variables, State size as the independent variable, and adjusting for Party and Chamber as covariates\",\n}\n\nIn this case, the most appropriate statistical test is multiple linear regression. The dependent variables are the in-degree and out-degree, the independent variable is the State size, and the covariates are Party and Chamber. By adjusting for Party and Chamber, we can investigate the association between State size and the in-degree and out-degree while controlling for potential confounding factors.",

In this study, we analyze Twitter interactions among members of the US Congress to gain insights into the dynamics of their online engagement. By constructing a directed graph that maps the social interactions among Congress members, we investigate the structure of the network and explore the likelihood of interactions across different attributes such as Represented State, Political Party, and Chamber. Our findings reveal distinct patterns in the network, highlighting the importance of party affiliation and chamber membership in shaping online interactions. We also identify the impact of state size on the number of interactions received and initiated.

Understanding the dynamics of online interactions among elected officials is vital for studying political discourse in the digital age. In this study, we analyze a comprehensive dataset of Twitter interactions among members of the US Congress, spanning a 4-month period. By constructing a directed graph, we investigate the structure of the network and examine the likelihood of interactions across attributes such as Represented State, Political Party, and Chamber. Our findings reveal distinct patterns in the network, highlighting the role of party affiliation and chamber membership in shaping online interactions. Additionally, we find that state size influences the number of interactions received and initiated. These results underscore the importance of party dynamics and legislative chambers in shaping political engagement on Twitter. However, it should be noted that our analysis is based on a limited dataset, which may introduce biases and limit generalizability. Nonetheless, our study provides valuable insights into the dynamics of online political engagement and has implications for fostering meaningful interactions among political leaders on social media platforms.\n\\end{abstract}\n```",

    "\\section{Results}\nThe results of our analysis provide valuable insights into the patterns and dynamics of Twitter interactions among members of the US Congress. We conducted several analyses to understand the influence of various factors on online political engagement. The tables presented in this section highlight important findings and contribute to our understanding of digital discourse in the context of Congress.\n\nFirst, we explored the descriptive statistics of the network, stratified by Party and Chamber (Table \\ref{table:desc_stats_party_chamber}). This analysis aimed to examine the differences in Twitter interactions among members based on their political affiliation and chamber membership. The results indicate that members from different parties and chambers exhibit variations in the average number of interactions received and initiated. For example, Democrat Senators receive an average of 24.2 interactions, while Republican Senators receive 20.4 interactions. Similarly, the House members of both parties tend to receive more interactions compared to Senators. These findings suggest that party affiliation and chamber membership play a significant role in shaping Twitter interactions among Congress members.\n\nNext, we performed a multiple linear regression analysis to investigate the relationship between the number of Twitter interactions (in-degree and out-degree) and the size of the state represented by a Congress member, while adjusting for Party and Chamber (Table \\ref{table:regression_state_size_interaction}). This analysis aimed to explore whether the size of the state has an impact on the level of engagement on social media. The results show that state size has a statistically significant impact on out-degree (p-value = 0.0118), suggesting that members representing larger states tend to initiate more interactions. However, the coefficient for in-degree was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.7). These findings indicate that the size of the state represented by a Congress member influences the number of interactions they initiate on Twitter, but not the interactions they receive.\n\nIn summary, these results show that party affiliation, chamber membership, and state size are important factors that influence Twitter interactions among members of the US Congress. The analysis highlights the variations in online engagement based on political factors and provides insights into the complex dynamics of online political discourse. These findings contribute to our understanding of digital communication among political leaders and pave the way for fostering meaningful interactions on social media platforms.",
    "```latex\n\\section{Results}\n\nFirst, to understand the patterns of Twitter interactions among members of the US Congress, we conducted a descriptive analysis. Table \\ref{table:desc_stats_party_chamber} presents the descriptive statistics of Size, In-Degree, and Out-Degree, stratified by Party and Chamber. We observed that members of the Democrat party in the House had an average Size of 21.1, receiving an average of 28.5 In-Degree interactions and initiating 27 Out-Degree interactions. On the other hand, members of the Republican party in the Senate had an average Size of 8.63, receiving an average of 20.4 In-Degree interactions and initiating 26.6 Out-Degree interactions. These findings suggest that there are differences in online engagement patterns across party affiliations and chambers.\n\nNext, we performed multiple linear regression analysis to investigate the relationship between State Size and Twitter interactions, while adjusting for Party and Chamber. The results of this analysis are shown in Table \\ref{table:regression_state_size_interaction}. We found that State Size was not significantly associated with either In-Degree (coefficient = -0.03, p-value = 0.7) or Out-Degree (coefficient = 0.164, p-value = 0.0118) interactions. Additionally, we observed that being a member of the Senate (Sen) was associated with fewer In-Degree interactions (coefficient = -7.24, p-value = 0.00653), while having a positive but non-significant effect on Out-Degree interactions (coefficient = 3.26, p-value = 0.142).\n\nIn summary, these results highlight the differences in online engagement patterns among members of the US Congress based on party affiliation and chamber membership. We found that Democrats in the House tended to have larger network sizes and receive more Twitter interactions, while Republicans in the Senate had smaller network sizes but a comparable number of interactions. Furthermore, our regression analysis suggests that State Size does not have a significant impact on the number of Twitter interactions received or initiated by Congress members, after adjusting for Party and Chamber. These findings provide insights into the dynamics of online political engagement and lay the foundation for further investigations into the factors influencing digital discourse in the context of Congress.\n\n```",
