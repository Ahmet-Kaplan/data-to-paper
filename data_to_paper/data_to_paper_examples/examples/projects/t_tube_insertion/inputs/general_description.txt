Pediatric patients have a shorter tracheal length than adults; therefore, the safety margin for tracheal tube tip positioning is narrow. However, the tracheal tube tip is misplaced in 35%â€“50% of pediatric patients and can cause hypoxia, atelectasis, hypercarbia, pneumothorax, and even death. Therefore, in pediatric patients who require mechanical ventilation, it is crucial to ensure the tracheal tube is placed at an optimum depth. The dataset includes data about pediatric patients aged < 7 years who received post-operative mechanical ventilation after undergoing surgery at Samsung Medical Center between January 2015 and December 2018. The dataset contains data from patient electronic health records and anatomical information retrieved from chest X-ray images.
