Here is our Research Goal


## Research Goal:

To construct and test 1 machine-learning model and 1 formula-based model for the optimal tracheal tube depth (defined here as `OTTD`, not an official term). 

### ML MODEL:
Using the provided features (age, sex, height, weight), your analysis code should create and evaluate the following 1 machine learning model for predicting the OTTD:

- Random Forest (RF)

Important: It is necessary to hyper-parameter tune the model.

### FORMULA-BASED MODEL:
Your analysis code should compute the following 1 formula-based model for the OTTD:

- Height Formula-based Model:
OTTD = height [cm] / 10 + 5 cm 


## Hypothesis:

- The machine-learning model will have a significantly better predictive power than the formula-based model (as measured by their squared residuals (prediction - target)**2 on the same test set).
