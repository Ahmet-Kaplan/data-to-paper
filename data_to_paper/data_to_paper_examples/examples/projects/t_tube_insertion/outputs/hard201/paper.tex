\title{Machine Learning Models Outperform Formula-based Methods in Predicting Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth in Pediatric Patients}
\author{Data to Paper}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Determining the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation is critical for patient safety. Existing formula-based methods and chest X-rays have limitations in accurately determining OTTD. We conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis between machine learning models and formula-based methods to predict OTTD in pediatric patients aged 0-7 years who underwent surgery. Our analysis utilized a dataset from Samsung Medical Center, comprising OTTD determined by chest X-ray and patient features from electronic health records. Machine learning models, including Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network, significantly outperformed formula-based models, such as the Height Formula, Age Formula, and ID Formula, in predicting OTTD. These findings highlight the potential of machine learning models as valuable tools for precise determination of OTTD in pediatric patients. However, considerations such as ethical concerns, model interpretability, and generalizability of results should be addressed. Integrating machine learning models can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of determining OTTD, improving patient outcomes in pediatric mechanical ventilation settings.

\section*{Results}

To investigate the performance of machine learning models compared to formula-based methods in predicting the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) in pediatric patients, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis. Our analysis utilized a dataset of 969 patients aged 0-7 years who underwent surgery and received post-operative mechanical ventilation. We compared the performance of machine learning models (Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network) to formula-based models (Height Formula, Age Formula, and ID Formula). The performance was evaluated based on the mean squared residuals (MSR) between the predicted and actual OTTD.

First, we examined the performance of the machine learning models and formula-based models on individual test samples (Table \ref{table:msr_comparison}). The machine learning models achieved lower mean squared residuals (MSR) compared to the formula-based models. Specifically, the Random Forest model had an MSR of 1.5, the Elastic Net model had an MSR of 1.15, the Support Vector Machine model had an MSR of 1.2, and the Neural Network model had an MSR of 1.27. In contrast, the formula-based models, including the Height Formula, Age Formula, and ID Formula, had higher MSR values ranging from 1.84 to 3.54. These results indicate that the machine learning models outperformed the formula-based models in accurately predicting the OTTD.

\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}


Next, we performed a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare the prediction errors between the machine learning models and formula-based models (Table \ref{table:pv_comparison}). The p-values obtained from the test revealed significant differences between the machine learning models and the formula-based models for all comparisons. Specifically, the prediction errors of the machine learning models were significantly lower compared to the Height Formula (p-value $<$ $10^{-6}$), Age Formula (p-value $<$ $10^{-6}$), and ID Formula (p-value $<$ $10^{-6}$). These findings further support the superior performance of the machine learning models in predicting OTTD.

In summary, our analysis demonstrates that machine learning models significantly outperformed formula-based methods in accurately predicting the optimal tracheal tube depth in pediatric patients. The machine learning models, including Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network, exhibited lower mean squared residuals compared to formula-based models such as the Height Formula, Age Formula, and ID Formula. These results highlight the potential of machine learning models as valuable tools for precise determination of OTTD in pediatric patients.

\section{Data Description} \label{sec:data_description} Here is the data description, as provided by the user:

\begin{Verbatim}[tabsize=4]
Rationale: Pediatric patients have a shorter tracheal length than adults;
	therefore, the safety margin for tracheal tube tip positioning is narrow.
Indeed, the tracheal tube tip is misplaced in 35%â€“50% of pediatric patients and
	can cause hypoxia, atelectasis, hypercarbia, pneumothorax, and even death.
Therefore, in pediatric patients who require mechanical ventilation, it is
	crucial to determine the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (defined here as `OTTD`,
	not an official term).

Note: For brevity, we introduce the term `OTTD` to refer to the "optimal
	tracheal tube depth". This is not an official term that can be found in the
	literature.

Existing methods: The gold standard to determine OTTD is by chest X-ray, which
	is time-consuming and requires radiation exposure.
Alternatively, formula-based models on patient features such as age and height
	are used to determine OTTD, but with limited success.

The provided dataset focus on patients aged 0-7 year old who received post-
	operative mechanical ventilation after undergoing surgery at Samsung Medical
	Center between January 2015 and December 2018.
For each of these patients, the dataset provides the OTTD determined by chest
	X-ray as well as features extracted from patient electronic health records.


1 data file:

"tracheal_tube_insertion.csv"
The csv file is a clean dataset of 969 rows (patients) and 6 columns:

Tube:
#1 `tube` - "tube ID", internal diameter of the tube (mm) [Included only for the
	formula-based model; Do not use as a machine-learning model feature]

Model features:
#2 `sex` - patient sex (0=female, 1=male)
#3 `age_c` - patient age (years, rounded to half years)
#4 `ht` - patient height (cm)
#5 `wt` - patient weight (kg)

Target:
#6 `tube_depth_G` - Optimal tracheal tube depth as determined by chest X-ray (in
	cm)

\subsection{Code Description}

The provided code performs an analysis to compare the predictive power of machine learning (ML) models and formula-based models for determining the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) in pediatric patients who require mechanical ventilation. The goal is to find an accurate and efficient alternative to the time-consuming and radiation-exposing chest X-ray method.

The code first loads a dataset containing information about the patients, including their sex, age, height, weight, and the OTTD determined by chest X-ray. The dataset is then split into training and test sets.

Next, the code applies various ML models, including Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network, to predict the OTTD. Each model is tuned using cross-validation to find the best hyperparameters. The models are evaluated based on mean squared residuals between the predicted and actual OTTD values in the test set.

In addition to the ML models, the code also includes formula-based models that calculate the OTTD based on patient features (height, age, and tube internal diameter). These formula-based models are used as a comparison to the ML models.

The code calculates the mean squared residuals for each model, including both the ML models and the formula-based models. The results are saved in a table, named "table\_1.pkl". This table provides a comparison of the predictive power of the ML models and the formula-based models on individual test samples.

Furthermore, a statistical comparison is performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare the errors between the ML models and the formula-based models. The p-values resulting from the test are stored in a table, named "table\_2.pkl". This table provides a quantitative comparison of the errors between the two groups of models.

Finally, the code saves additional results in a file named "additional\_results.pkl". These additional results include the total number of observations in the dataset, the number of training samples, and the number of test samples.

In summary, the code performs an analysis to evaluate the predictive power of ML models compared to formula-based models for determining the optimal tracheal tube depth in pediatric patients. The results provide insights into the accuracy and efficiency of different methods for this important clinical task.
