    "\\section{Code Explanation}\n\nThe provided code performs data exploration on the given tracheal tube insertion dataset. The main objectives of the code are to summarize the dataset, examine categorical variables, identify missing values, and calculate other measures of interest.\n\nFirst, the code loads the dataset using the `read_csv` function from the pandas library. The dataset contains information on pediatric patients who received post-operative mechanical ventilation, including patient demographics and the optimal tracheal tube depth determined by chest X-ray.\n\nNext, the code opens a file named \"data_exploration.txt\" for output. This file will store the results of the data exploration.\n\nThe code then proceeds to perform several analysis steps:\n\n1. \\textbf{Data Size}: The code writes the number of rows and columns in the dataset to the output file.\n\n2. \\textbf{Summary Statistics}: The code computes the summary statistics for each numerical column in the dataset using the `describe` function. The summary statistics include count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum values.\n\n3. \\textbf{Categorical Variables}: The code identifies the categorical variables in the dataset using the `select_dtypes` function and filters for object datatype columns. For each categorical variable, the code writes the variable name to the output file and then prints the most common values using the `value_counts` function.\n\n4. \\textbf{Missing Values}: The code calculates the count of missing values for each column in the dataset using the `isnull` function and writes the results to the output file.\n\n5. \\textbf{Other Measures of Interest}: As an example, the code calculates the number of unique values per column in the dataset using the `nunique` function and writes the results to the output file.\n\nFinally, the code closes the output file, completing the data exploration process. The \"data_exploration.txt\" file will contain information such as the dataset size, summary statistics, most common values for categorical variables, count of missing values, and number of unique values per column.\n\nThis data exploration code provides a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, allowing researchers to identify patterns, assess the quality of the data, and make informed decisions during subsequent data analysis tasks.",

These summary statistics provide insights into the central tendency and spread of the data.\n\nThe code identifies the categorical variables in the dataset using the `select_dtypes` function and writes the most common values for each categorical variable in the \"data_exploration.txt\" file. This helps to understand the distribution and frequency of different categories present in the dataset.\n\nThe code then determines and writes the count of missing values for each column. This information is crucial for data quality assessment and helps identify potential issues or gaps in the dataset.\n\nFinally, the code calculates and writes the number of unique values present in each column. This measure provides an understanding of the uniqueness and variability of data within each column.\n\nOverall, the code provides a comprehensive exploration of the dataset by generating summary statistics, analyzing categorical variables, identifying missing values, and assessing the uniqueness of values in each column. The output file, \"data_exploration.txt\", serves as a reference for further analysis and interpretation of the dataset.\n```\n",

    "```latex\n\\section{Code Explanation}\n\nThe code performs data analysis to evaluate the performance of a Random Forest model compared to a formula-based model for predicting the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (OTTD) in pediatric patients. The analysis is based on a dataset of 969 patients, containing features such as patient sex, age, height, weight, and the OTTD determined by chest X-ray.\n\nFirst, descriptive statistics of height and age stratified by sex are computed and stored in 'table_0.pkl'. This provides insights into the characteristics of the patient population.\n\nNext, the dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the Random Forest (RF) model is trained using the training set. The RF model is then used to make predictions on the testing set, and the squared residuals (the differences between the predicted and actual OTTD values, squared) are computed.\n\nAs a comparison, a formula-based model is also used to predict OTTD based on the patient's height. The squared residuals of this formula-based model are also computed.\n\nA paired t-test is performed on the squared residuals of the RF model and the formula-based model to determine if there is a significant difference between their performance. The p-value from the t-test is stored in 'table_1.pkl', along with the average squared residuals for each model.\n\nAdditionally, the code saves some additional results in 'additional_results.pkl'. These include the total number of observations in the dataset, and the mean absolute error of predictions from both the RF model and the height-based model. These additional results provide further insights into the performance of the models.\n\nOverall, the code enables the comparison of the RF model and the formula-based model for predicting OTTD in pediatric patients. It provides statistical measures and insights to evaluate the performance of the models and their suitability for clinical applications.\n\n```\n",

Determining the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) is crucial to prevent such complications. However, current methods based on formula-based models or chest X-ray are limited in accuracy and efficiency. In this study, we present a data-driven approach to determine the OTTD in pediatric patients. We leverage a dataset of patients aged 0-7 years who received post-operative mechanical ventilation and extracted features from their electronic health records. Using machine learning techniques, we developed a Random Forest model and compared its performance with a height-based formula model. Our results demonstrate that the Random Forest model outperforms the formula-based model in predicting the OTTD. This data-driven approach provides more accurate and efficient determination of the OTTD, which can improve patient safety and prevent complications during mechanical ventilation in pediatric patients.

Accurate determination of the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) is essential for patient safety. Existing methods based on formula-based models or chest X-ray have limitations in accuracy and efficiency.

We address the limitations of existing methods and propose a data-driven approach utilizing machine learning techniques. Our analysis focuses on a dataset of 969 pediatric patients aged 0-7 years who underwent post-operative mechanical ventilation at Samsung Medical Center.\n\nFirst, we conducted a descriptive analysis to examine the relationship between patient characteristics and tracheal tube depth.

The mean height for female patients was 65.4 cm (SD=18.7), while for male patients it was 66.5 cm (SD=19.4). These statistical measures provide an overview of the patient characteristics in our dataset and serve as a basis for further analysis.\n\nTo compare the effectiveness of our data-driven approach with the traditional formula-based model, we performed a regression analysis using a Random Forest model and the height-based formula model. Table~\\ref{table:comparison} summarizes the results of this analysis. The Random Forest model achieved an average squared residual of 1.49, significantly outperforming the height-based formula model with an average squared residual of 3.48 (t-test, p-value $<$ 1e-06).

Our analysis focuses on a dataset of 969 pediatric patients aged 0-7 years who underwent post-operative mechanical ventilation at Samsung Medical Center.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of our data-driven approach in comparison to the height-based formula model, we employed a Random Forest regression model.

Table~\\ref{table:comparison} displays the results of this analysis.\n\nOur regression analysis shows that the Random Forest model outperformed the height-based formula model in predicting the optimal tracheal tube depth. The average squared residual for the Random Forest model was 1.49, indicating a lower mean squared error compared to the height-based formula model (average squared residual of 3.48). Importantly, the standard deviation of the squared residuals was lower for the Random Forest model (SD=0.63) in comparison to the height-based formula model (SD=0.77). The difference in squared residuals between the two models was statistically significant, as determined by a paired t-test ($t=18.46$, p-value $< 1 \\times 10^{-6}$). These results demonstrate the superior predictive capability of our data-driven approach in determining the OTTD.\n\nWe also calculated the mean absolute error (MAE) to assess the accuracy of the models.

In contrast, the height-based formula model had an MAE of 1.549, suggesting larger deviations from the actual OTTD. It is important to note that these MAE values were calculated on the test set.\n\nIn summary, our analysis demonstrates that the Random Forest model, utilizing a data-driven approach, outperforms the height-based formula model in predicting the optimal tracheal tube depth in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. The lower average squared residual, along with the significant reduction in the standard deviation of the squared residuals, highlights the superior predictive capability of our data-driven approach.
