    "\\section{Code Explanation}\n\nThe provided code performs data exploration on the \"tracheal_tube_insertion.csv\" dataset using the pandas library in Python. The code aims to provide an overview of the dataset, including its size, summary statistics, information about categorical variables, and missing values.\n\nFirst, the dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame named \"df\" using the `read_csv` function.\n\nThe code then opens a file named \"data_exploration.txt\" to write the exploration results.\n\n\\subsection{Data Size}\nThe code writes information about the size of the dataset to the file. This includes the number of rows and columns in the dataset.\n\n\\subsection{Summary Statistics}\nNext, the code computes and writes the summary statistics of the dataset to the file. This includes measures like count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, quartiles, and maximum for each numerical column in the dataset.\n\n\\subsection{Categorical Variables}\nThe code identifies any categorical variables in the dataset and provides information about their most common values. For each categorical column, the code writes the top five most frequent values and their respective counts to the file. This information can give insights into the distribution and prevalence of categories within these variables.\n\n\\subsection{Missing Values}\nFinally, the code checks for missing values in the dataset and writes the count of missing values for each column to the file. This information allows researchers to identify and handle missing data appropriately before further analysis.\n\nOverall, the code provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including its size, summary statistics, information about categorical variables, and any missing values. This exploration is essential for understanding the data and making informed decisions for subsequent analysis. The \"data_exploration.txt\" file serves as a documentation of the dataset and its characteristics, allowing other researchers to reproduce the analysis or gain insights from the provided summary information.",
    "```latex\n\\section{Code Explanation}\n\nThe provided code performs data exploration on the dataset \"tracheal_tube_insertion.csv\". It conducts several analysis steps to gain insights into the dataset.\n\n1. Data Size:\n   The code first calculates the number of rows and columns in the dataset using the shape attribute of the DataFrame. It then writes this information into the \"data_exploration.txt\" file.\n\n2. Summary Statistics:\n   The code calculates the summary statistics of the numerical variables in the dataset using the describe() function. This includes count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum values for each feature. The summary statistics are then written into the \"data_exploration.txt\" file.\n\n3. Categorical Variables:\n   The code identifies the categorical variables in the dataset using the select_dtypes() function with the 'object' parameter. It then determines the most common values for each categorical variable using the value_counts() function, and selects the top 5 values. These most common values are written into the \"data_exploration.txt\" file.\n\n4. Missing Values:\n   The code checks for missing values in the dataset using the isnull() function, which returns a DataFrame of the same shape with True values for missing values and False values otherwise. It then calculates the sum of missing values for each feature using the sum() function. The number of missing values for each feature is written into the \"data_exploration.txt\" file.\n\nThe \"data_exploration.txt\" file serves as a record of the data exploration analysis, providing information on data size, summary statistics, most common categorical variable values, and missing values. These insights are crucial for understanding the characteristics and quality of the dataset, which can guide subsequent data preprocessing and modeling steps.\n```\n",

    "(1) Review of Relevant Statistical Issues:\n\n- Multiple comparisons: This issue is not relevant in this case as we are comparing the predictive power of different models, rather than conducting multiple hypothesis tests on the same data.\n\n- Confounding variables: In this case, none of the variables in the dataset can be considered potential confounding variables. We are specifically interested in the predictive power of the machine learning models and formula-based models for the OTTD, and the dataset does not provide any additional variables that could confound this relationship.\n\n- Dependencies between data points: There might be dependencies between data points as the dataset consists of patients from the same hospital who received mechanical ventilation after surgery. These dependencies should be accounted for in the statistical analysis.\n\n- Missing data points: According to the data exploration output, there are no missing data points in the dataset. Therefore, missing data imputation is not necessary for this analysis.\n\n- Other relevant statistical issues: One potential issue is the hyper-parameter tuning for the machine learning models. It is important to optimize the hyper-parameters of each model in order to achieve the best performance and avoid overfitting.\n\n(2) Mapping of Hypotheses to Statistical Tests:\n\n{\n \"Each of the 4 machine learning models will have significantly better predictive power than each of the formula-based models\":\n \"Use a paired t-test to compare the squared residuals of the machine learning models and formula-based models on the same test set. Correct for dependencies between data points using a cluster-robust standard errors approach.\",\n}\n\nNote: The paired t-test is used to compare the mean difference between two models (in this case, machine learning models and formula-based models) based on their squared residuals. The cluster-robust standard errors approach is employed to account for potential dependencies between data points.\n\nPlease note that there are other possible statistical tests that can be used for hypothesis testing, such as cross-validation or model selection based on information criteria (e.g., AIC or BIC). However, the paired t-test is selected here as a simple and straightforward approach to test the specified hypothesis.",

    "\\section{Code Explanation}\n\nThe provided code performs data analysis on a dataset of pediatric patients who underwent surgery and received post-operative mechanical ventilation. The aim of the analysis is to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) for these patients based on their sex, age, height, weight, and tube ID. \n\nThe code begins by importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset from the \"tracheal_tube_insertion.csv\" file. The dataset contains information on the tube ID, patient sex, age (rounded to half years), height, weight, and the optimal tracheal tube depth (tube_depth_G) determined by chest X-ray.\n\nNext, the code calculates and saves the descriptive statistics of the height and tube_depth_G variables stratified by sex. The results are stored in a pickled file named \"table_0.pkl\" for further analysis.\n\nThe dataset is then preprocessed by converting the categorical variable \"sex\" into dummy variables using one-hot encoding. The data is split into training and test sets, with 80% of the data used for training models and 20% for evaluation.\n\nThe code proceeds to perform the analysis using four different regression models: Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network (MLPRegressor). Each model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set. The residuals (the differences between the predicted and actual tube_depth_G values) are calculated for each model and stored for further analysis.\n\nFurthermore, formula-based models are calculated based on the height, age, and tube ID variables. These formula-based models are defined outside the code and do not rely on machine learning algorithms. The residuals for these formula-based models are also calculated and stored for comparison.\n\nFinally, the code calculates and saves the residual sum of squares (RSS) and p-values for each model and formula-based model, comparing them to a null hypothesis of zero residuals. The results are stored in a pickled file named \"table_1.pkl\".\n\nIn addition, the code saves some additional results in a pickled file named \"additional_results.pkl\". These results include the total number of observations in the dataset and the total number of observations in the test set.\n\nOverall, the code performs data analysis and modeling techniques to determine the most accurate model for predicting the optimal tracheal tube depth for pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation after surgery.",

The goal is to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) for these patients using various models and compare their performance. \n\nThe dataset is loaded from the \"tracheal_tube_insertion.csv\" file, which contains information such as patient age, height, weight, and the chest X-ray determined OTTD. \n\nThe code starts by calculating descriptive statistics of height and OTTD stratified by patient sex and stores the results in \"table_0.pkl\" file. \n\nNext, the dataset is preprocessed by creating dummy variables for the 'sex' column to be used in the analysis. The data is then split into train and test datasets for model evaluation. \n\nFour different models are trained on the train dataset, namely Random Forest Regression, Elastic Net Regression, Support Vector Machine Regression, and MLP Regression. The trained models are then used to make predictions on the test dataset. The residuals (the differences between the predicted values and the actual OTTD) are calculated for each model.\n\nAdditionally, formula-based models are constructed using patient features like height, age, and tube ID. These formula-based models are evaluated on the test dataset by calculating the residuals. \n\nA comparison of the residual sum of squares (RSS) between the different models and the formula-based models is performed, and the results are stored in \"table_1.pkl\". The p-values for each model's residuals are also calculated.\n\nFinally, the code saves additional results including the total number of observations in the dataset and the total number of observations in the test dataset in the \"additional_results.pkl\" file.\n\nOverall, the code performs data analysis by training models, evaluating their performance, and comparing them to formula-based models to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth for pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.\n\n```",

The mean tube ID was similar for both sexes, with females having a mean of 3.68 and males having a mean of 3.7.

The dataset included variables such as patient sex, age, height, weight, and the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) as determined by chest X-ray.\n\n\\subsection{Data Preprocessing}\nPrior to analysis, the dataset underwent preprocessing. This preprocessing was performed using Python code as described in the \"Data Analysis Code\" section. The preprocessing steps included the creation of dummy variables for the \"sex\" column and the splitting of the data into training and test datasets using a 80:20 train-test split ratio.\n\n\\subsection{Data Analysis}\nOnce the data preprocessing was completed, the analysis was performed using several machine learning and formula-based models. The machine learning models used in this study were Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network. Each model was trained on the training dataset and then evaluated on the test dataset. Mean squared error was used as the evaluation metric for the machine learning models.\n\nIn addition to the machine learning models, formula-based models were also evaluated. The formula-based models included the height formula, age formula, and ID formula. The height formula-based model was calculated by dividing the patient's height by 10 and adding 5 cm. The age formula-based model assigned specific OTTD values based on the patient's age group. Lastly, the ID formula-based model computed the OTTD by multiplying the internal diameter of the tracheal tube by 3.\n\nAfter the machine learning and formula-based models were trained and evaluated, the residuals were calculated for each model. The residuals represent the difference between the predicted OTTD and the actual OTTD as determined by chest X-ray. These residuals were then used to compare the predictive power of each model.\n\n```\n",

One critical aspect of effective mechanical ventilation is the precise positioning of the tracheal tube, with the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) being particularly significant. However, pediatric patients' shorter tracheal length provides a narrow safety margin, thus complicating the determination of OTTD. Any misplacement of the tracheal tube may lead to severe complications, including hypoxia, atelectasis, hypercarbia, pneumothorax, and even death \\cite{Weiss2006ClinicalEO}.\n\nConventionally, methods such as chest X-ray and formula-based models have been used to estimate OTTD, but each has limitations. While chest X-ray provides a direct method of verification, it is time-consuming and exposes patients to ionizing radiation \\cite{Thomas2017ReliabilityOU}. Formula-based models, which incorporate patient attributes such as age and height, have produced variable results and do not always yield the desired accuracy in pediatric populations \\cite{Mariano2005ACO}.\n\nAddressing these limitations, our study leverages the comprehensive dataset of pediatric patients aged 0-7 years, gathered from Samsung Medical Center. The dataset is uniquely characterized by the breadth of patient attributes, including age, sex, height, and weight, along with the actual OTTD as determined by chest X-ray \\cite{Kuzin2007FamilyMemberPD,OBoyle2014DevelopmentOL,Kerrey2009APC}. \n\nTo uncover hidden patterns within this data, this study employs a range of machine learning algorithms, including random forest, elastic net, support vector machine, and a neural network, alongside the traditional height, age, and tube internal diameter-based formulas. This data-driven approach aims to provide a reliable model for predicting OTTD, enhancing the precision of mechanical ventilation management in pediatric patients \\cite{Narula2018EnteralNT}. By accurately estimating the OTTD, this approach holds significant potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of post-operation complications in the pediatric population \\cite{Ednick2008PostoperativeRO}.\n```",
    "```latex\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nThe main objective of our study was to estimate Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation using a data-driven approach \\cite{Wu2013RealtimeTU}. The preciseness of tube placement in these patients is crucial due to their shorter tracheal length and the severe complications that can result from any tube misplacement, including hypoxia and pneumothorax \\cite{Dalens1989ComparisonOT, Loundon2010MedicalAS}. Conventional methods such as chest X-rays and formula-based models have certain limitations in determining the OTTD, particularly concerning time effectiveness, exposure to radiation, and limited accuracy \\cite{Thomas2017ReliabilityOU, Elfadil2022SafetyAE}. \n\nIn our method, we utilized machine learning algorithms and formula-based models using data from pediatric patients. Predominantly, our results revealed that machine learning algorithms provided a reasonable estimation of the OTTD. Also, formula-based models exhibited similar performance, despite higher residual sums of squares indicating larger deviations from the actual OTTD. These findings align with Thomas et al. \\cite{Thomas2017ReliabilityOU} endorsement of a similar approach using ultrasonography to determine tube placement in real-time, and extends the applicability to the case of pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. \n\nOne major limitation of this study comes from the demographic characteristics of the patient population we considered. As our dataset is collected only from Samsung Medical Center, and only includes pediatric patients aged 0-7 years, our findings may not generalize to all pediatric populations or to older patient age groups. Additionally, as the dataset is retrospective and observational in nature, there may be inherent bias and residual confounding that is not adequately controlled for within the models. Furthermore, our models' performance relied heavily on mean squared error, a measure of accuracy, while other metrics of performance like precision, recall, and the area under the curve, were not considered. \n\nIn conclusion, by applying a data-driven approach using machine learning algorithms, alongside traditional formulas based on height, age, and tube ID, our study exhibits the potential of addressing the significant clinical challenge of estimating OTTD in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. It's important to note though that the machine learning models and the ID formula-based model require further validation and refinements for clinical applications. Implementing these approaches may drastically enhance patient safety during mechanical ventilation, proactively contributing to minimization of serious complications. Looking forward to future directions, there's a need for studies that would expand this analysis to more diverse and older pediatric populations, and alternative performance metrics. \n```\n",

    "```latex\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nOur study embarked on a significant task of estimating the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (OTTD) in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation by encapsulating a data-driven approach \\cite{Wu2013RealtimeTU}. Precise tracheal tube placement is a critical concern in pediatric medicine due to the shorter tracheal length in children and the severe complications that may arise from misplacement, including hypoxia, atelectasis, hypercarbia, pneumothorax, and even death \\cite{Dalens1989ComparisonOT, Loundon2010MedicalAS}. The conventional techniques of determining OTTD, involving chest X-rays and formula-based models, present challenges regarding time effectiveness, exposure to radiation, and limited accuracy, which our study aimed to overcome \\cite{Thomas2017ReliabilityOU, Elfadil2022SafetyAE}. \n\nOur methodologies involved machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network, as well as, formula-based models that factored in height, age, and Tube ID. The findings discerned from the datasets, although conforming to the premises laid out by Thomas et al.\\cite{Thomas2017ReliabilityOU}, require cautious interpretation. We noticed that while machine learning algorithms manifested reasonable accuracy, the formula-based models, despite aligning closely, exhibited larger deviation from the actual OTTD. This discrepancy indicates potential limitations with formula-based models, including possible oversimplification and unaccounted nonlinear relationships \\cite{Lauguico2020ACA, Sher2022PilotSO}.\n\nThe scope and dimension of this study impose certain limitations. The study heavily relied on the mean squared error as an accuracy metric, while important factors such as precision, recall, and area under the curve were not considered. This omission limits our comprehensive understanding of our model's performance capabilities \\cite{Sher2022PilotSO}.\n\nAdditionally, the demographic data used in the study stems from a single-center, Samsung Medical Center, therfore, our study's findings might have limited generalizability \\cite{Fleming2019ClinicalAS}. The bias and residual confounding that might be present in the dataset due to its retrospective and observational nature could also indirectly affect the accuracy of our models.\n\nMoreover, future studies need to improve upon this data-driven approach by considering algorithm improvements and the inclusion of new patient features that might have an impact on OTTD. Studies should aim at confirming these results on a larger, more diverse population of pediatric patients to enhance the utility of these machine learning methodologies. \n\nDespite these limitations, our findings indeed offer promising aspects, highlighting the potential of our data-driven approach in estimating the OTTD in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. However, our results are prefatory, and while the approaches considered in this study can offer valuable insights for enhancing patient safety during mechanical ventilation, they should be meticulously refined and externally validated for their broader application. \n\nIn closing, our study showcases the promising potential of a data-driven approach in augmenting the precision of OTTD estimation, thus playing a significant role in improving post-operative outcomes of pediatric patients. While the pathway to development and implementation of machine learning models show promise, they demand comprehensive future research for refined efficiency and all-encompassing clinical applicability. The prospective implementation of the findings from this study could indeed contribute monumentally towards reducing severe complications inherent to pediatric mechanical ventilations \\cite{Lauguico2020ACA}.\n\n```\n"
