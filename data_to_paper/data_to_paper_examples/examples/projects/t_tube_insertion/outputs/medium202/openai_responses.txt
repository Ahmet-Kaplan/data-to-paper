    "(1) Review of Relevant Statistical Issues:\n\n- Multiple Comparisons: Not relevant in this case as we have only two models (ML model and formula-based model) being compared.\n\n- Confounding Variables: We need to consider the potential confounding variables that may influence the relationship between features (age, sex, height, weight) and the OTTD. This can be addressed by adjusting for confounding variables in the statistical analysis.\n\n- Dependencies between data points: We need to consider if there are any dependencies between data points. If there are dependencies, such as multiple records from the same patient, we should account for these dependencies to avoid inflated significance levels or biased estimates.\n\n- Missing Data Points: It is important to determine if there are any missing data points and handle them appropriately. Missing data can introduce bias and affect the validity of the statistical analysis.\n\n- Other Relevant Statistical Issues: We should also consider issues related to model selection, such as overfitting and generalizability of the models. Additionally, since we are comparing a machine-learning model and a formula-based model, we should consider the interpretability and practicality of the models in a clinical context.\n\n\n(2) Hypothesis Testing Plan:\n\nBased on the stated hypotheses, we can suggest the following statistical tests:\n\nHypothesis: The machine-learning model will have a significantly better predictive power than the formula-based model (as measured by their squared residuals on the same test set).\n\nStatistical Test: Paired t-test on the squared residuals of the predictions from the machine-learning model and the predictions from the formula-based model, using the same test set. This test will determine if there is a significant difference in the predictive power between the two models.\n\nNote: It is important to note that the test set should be independent of the training set and appropriately selected to ensure unbiased evaluation of the models.\n\nHence, the dictionary mapping the hypotheses to the most adequate statistical tests would be:\n\n```python\n{\n \"The machine-learning model will have a significantly better predictive power than the formula-based model\":\n \"Paired t-test on the squared residuals of the predictions from the machine-learning model and the predictions from the formula-based model\"\n}\n```\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance!",

The goal was to determine which model provides more accurate predictions of the OTTD for these patients.\n\nFirst, we examined the mean squared errors (MSEs) of the machine learning model and the formula-based model. As shown in Table \\ref{table:table_1}, the MSE for the machine learning model was 1.39, while the MSE for the formula-based model was 3.42. This indicates that the machine learning model achieved a significant improvement in predictive accuracy over the formula-based model, with a relative improvement of approximately 59.43\\%. The difference in MSEs between the two models was statistically significant (p $<$ 1e-6), demonstrating the superiority of the machine learning approach in estimating the OTTD in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.\n\nTo optimize the performance of the machine learning model, we performed hyperparameter tuning for the Random Forest model. The hyperparameters considered were the number of estimators (50, 100, and 200) and the maximum depth (None, 5, 10, 15, and 20). Through grid search with 5-fold cross-validation, we determined that the best parameters for the Random Forest model were a maximum depth of 5 and 200 estimators. These parameters were selected based on their ability to minimize the MSE during the training process, ensuring optimal predictive performance of the machine learning model.\n\nIn summary, our analysis of the machine learning model and the formula-based model revealed that the machine learning approach significantly outperformed the traditional formula-based approach in estimating the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.

Both models used demographic patient features, namely sex, age, height, and weight, to estimate OTTD.\n\nWe first looked into the Mean Squared Errors (MSEs) of the two models as an indicator of their predictive accuracy. As depicted in Table \\ref{table:table_1}, the MSE of the machine learning model was significantly lower (1.39) than that of the formula-based model (3.42), with a p-value less than 1e-06. Thus, our machine learning model provides a more accurate prediction of OTTD compared to the conventional formula-based approach.\n\nSubsequently, hyperparameter tuning was carried out on the training data to identify optimal values for the parameters of the Random Forest model - our chosen machine learning model. The parameters considered in our Grid Search included the `n_estimators` over a set of [50,100,200] and `max_depth` over [None,5,10,15,20]. As per the Grid Search outcome, the best performing model parameters were `max_depth` of 5 and `n_estimators` of 200. \n\nA comprehensive comparison of the two models was done, pertaining specifically to their prediction results. The machine learning model had a lower MSE implying a higher predictive accuracy compared to the traditional formula model. These results indicate that the machine learning model, which utilizes patient features extracted from electronic health records, offers a more precise estimation of OTTD, crucial in the safety of pediatric patients during mechanical ventilation.\n\nIn summary, our machine learning model outperformed the formula-based model, providing a significantly more accurate prediction of OTTD in pediatric patients, as evidenced by a lower MSE. The findings affirm the potential of machine learning in enhancing patient safety in clinical settings involving mechanical ventilation.\n```",

For a comparative analysis, we also evaluated the performance of a traditional formula-based model that utilizes parameters like sex, age, height, and weight to estimate the OTTD.\n\nThe predictive accuracy of both models was evaluated by comparing their Mean Squared Errors (MSE) as documented in Table \\ref{table:table_1}. The machine learning model achieved a lower MSE value of 1.39 over the formula-based model that registered an MSE of 3.42. Notably, the significant p-value (p $<$ 1e-06) lends further credibility to the superiority of the machine learning model in this context.\n\nFurther analysis of the predictive performance of the machine learning model involved hyperparameter tuning of the underlying Random Forest model. Parameters for maximum depth and estimators were tuned, with the best values identified as \\num{5} and \\num{200} respectively, as highlighted in the additional results data. \n\nIn conducting a direct comparative analysis between the predictions generated by the machine learning model and the formula-based model, it became evident that the machine learning model's lower MSE was indicative of higher predictive accuracy. Such findings corroborate the potential of machine learning models in leveraging electronic patient health records to generate more accurate estimations of OTTD in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.\n\nIn summary, the results from our analyses substantiate the supremacy of the machine-learning model over the traditional formula-based model in predicting the OTTD in pediatric conditions. Predicated upon patient features derived from electronic health records, our machine learning approach offers a more precise and reliable estimation of OTTD, thereby substantiating its potential in enhancing the safety of pediatric patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n```",
