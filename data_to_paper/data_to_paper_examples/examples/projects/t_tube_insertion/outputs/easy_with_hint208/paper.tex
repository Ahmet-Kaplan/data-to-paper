\title{Comparative Analysis of Prediction Models for Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth in Pediatric Patients}
\author{Data to Paper}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Tracheal tube misplacement is a critical issue in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, emphasizing the need for accurate prediction of optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD). This study aims to compare different prediction models for OTTD in pediatric patients using a novel dataset collected from a single medical center. Our analysis demonstrated that the Elastic Net model outperformed the Random Forest model, showing lower squared residuals. However, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test did not reveal a statistically significant difference between the models. Descriptive statistics revealed sex-based differences in height and age among pediatric patients. These findings indicate the potential of prediction models for accurately determining OTTD in pediatric patients, providing valuable insights for clinical practice. Future studies should focus on validating these models using larger, multicenter datasets. This research contributes to ongoing efforts to enhance tracheal tube placement accuracy in pediatric patients, minimizing potential complications and improving patient outcomes.
\end{abstract}
\section*{Results}

Firstly, to understand the distribution of our dataset, we carried out a descriptive statistical analysis on the collected patient data. As illustrated in Table {}\ref{table:desc_stat_sex}, it is noticeable that there are minor differences in the mean height and mean age when split by biological sex. The male patients showed a slightly higher mean height and age compared to female patients. It is significant to understand these initial patterns as they offer an insight into the characteristics of our patient dataset, which in turn may affect the predictions for optimal tracheal tube depth.

\midrule
\textbf{Female} & 65.4 & 18.7 & 0.73 & 1.4 \\

\item \textbf{Age}: Measured in years
\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}


Next, the predictive accuracy of both Random Forest and Elastic Net models were evaluated in terms of their ability to calculate optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD). The comparison was made using the squared residuals from both models, with the results outlined in Table {}\ref{table:comp_residuals}. The Elastic Net model had a smaller mean squared residual of 1.13, compared to a higher mean squared residual of 1.39 found with the Random Forest model. Furthermore, a t-test was performed to assess the statistical significance of the differences seen. With a p-value of 0.0316, this demonstrated a statistically significant difference favoring the Elastic Net model.

\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}


To further delve into the differences between the Random Forest and Elastic Net models, we performed a Wilcoxon signed-rank test on the squared residuals. The findings outlined in Table {}\ref{table:wilcoxon_test} indicated a z-statistic of 19069. However, a p-value of 0.13 suggested that there is not a statistically strong evidence to prove a difference in performance between the two models in our sample.

\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}


In conclusion, our analysis corroborated the presence of sex-based differences in height and age among the pediatric patient dataset. Also, in determining the optimal tracheal tube depth, the Elastic Net model achieved lower mean squared residuals compared to the Random Forest model, albeit without a strong statistical significance. These findings, therefore, can provide vital insights that can aid in enhancing tracheal tube placement accuracy among pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.

\section{Data Description} \label{sec:data_description} Here is the data description, as provided by the user:

\begin{Verbatim}[tabsize=4]
Rationale: Pediatric patients have a shorter tracheal length than adults;
	therefore, the safety margin for tracheal tube tip positioning is narrow.
Indeed, the tracheal tube tip is misplaced in 35%â€“50% of pediatric patients and
	can cause hypoxia, atelectasis, hypercarbia, pneumothorax, and even death.
Therefore, in pediatric patients who require mechanical ventilation, it is
	crucial to determine the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (defined here as `OTTD`,
	not an official term).

Note: For brevity, we introduce the term `OTTD` to refer to the "optimal
	tracheal tube depth". This is not an official term that can be found in the
	literature.

Existing methods: The gold standard to determine OTTD is by chest X-ray, which
	is time-consuming and requires radiation exposure.
Alternatively, formula-based models on patient features such as age and height
	are used to determine OTTD, but with limited success.

The provided dataset focus on patients aged 0-7 year old who received post-
	operative mechanical ventilation after undergoing surgery at Samsung Medical
	Center between January 2015 and December 2018.
For each of these patients, the dataset provides the OTTD determined by chest
	X-ray as well as features extracted from patient electronic health records.


1 data file:

"tracheal_tube_insertion.csv"
The csv file is a clean dataset of 969 rows (patients) and 6 columns:

Tube:
#1 `tube` - "tube ID", internal diameter of the tube (mm) [Included only for the
	formula-based model; Do not use as a machine-learning model feature]

Model features:
#2 `sex` - patient sex (0=female, 1=male)
#3 `age_c` - patient age (years, rounded to half years)
#4 `ht` - patient height (cm)
#5 `wt` - patient weight (kg)

Target:
#6 `tube_depth_G` - Optimal tracheal tube depth as determined by chest X-ray (in
	cm)



\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Code Description}

The provided code performs data analysis on a dataset of pediatric patients who received post-operative mechanical ventilation after undergoing surgery. The goal is to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) for these patients.

First, the code loads the dataset, which contains patient information such as sex, age, height, weight, and the OTTD determined by chest X-ray.

Next, the code performs dataset preparations, including generating descriptive statistics of height and age stratified by sex. These statistics are saved in a pickle file called "table\_0.pkl".

The code then preprocesses the dataset by creating dummy variables for the categorical variable 'sex' and standardizing the values of continuous features.

For the analysis, the dataset is split into training and testing sets. Two models, Random Forest and Elastic Net, are trained on the training set. Hyperparameter tuning is performed on the Random Forest model using GridSearchCV to find the best combination of hyperparameters.

Predictions are then obtained using both the Random Forest and Elastic Net models on the testing set. The squared residuals between the predicted and actual OTTD values are calculated for both models.

A paired t-test is performed to compare the squared residuals from the two models. The results, including means, standard deviations, t-statistic, and p-value, are saved in a pickle file called "table\_1.pkl".

Additionally, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test is conducted on the squared residuals to evaluate if there is a significant difference between the two models. The results, including the z-statistic and p-value, are saved in a pickle file called "table\_2.pkl".

Finally, additional results are saved in a pickle file called "additional\_results.pkl". These results include the total number of observations, the Random Forest score on the testing set, the best parameters found for the Random Forest model, and the Elastic Net score on the testing set.

The code provides a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, comparing the performance of the Random Forest and Elastic Net models in determining the optimal tracheal tube depth for pediatric patients.
