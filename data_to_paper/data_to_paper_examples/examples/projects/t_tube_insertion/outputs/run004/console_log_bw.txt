# Description of the Dataset
Description of the Dataset:

Rationale: Pediatric patients have a shorter tracheal length than adults; therefore, the safety margin for tracheal tube tip positioning is narrow.
Indeed, the tracheal tube tip is misplaced in 35%â€“50% of pediatric patients and can cause hypoxia, atelectasis, hypercarbia, pneumothorax, and even
death.
Therefore, in pediatric patients who require mechanical ventilation, it is crucial to determine the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (defined here as
`OTTD`, not an official term).

Note: For brevity, we introduce the term `OTTD` to refer to the "optimal tracheal tube depth". This is not an official term that can be found in the
literature.

Existing methods: The gold standard to determine OTTD is by chest X-ray, which is time-consuming and requires radiation exposure.
Alternatively, formula-based models on patient features such as age and height are used to determine OTTD, but with limited success.

Goal: Create and hyperparameter optimize different machine-learning models to predict OTTD, and to evaluate their performance compared to formula-
based methods.

Dataset: For this study, we curated a dataset for creating, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating machine-learning models to predict OTTD.

The provided dataset focus on patients aged 0-7 year old who received post-operative mechanical ventilation after undergoing surgery at Samsung
Medical Center between January 2015 and December 2018.
For each of these patients, the dataset provides the OTTD determined by chest X-ray as well as features extracted from patient electronic health
records.


1 data file:

"tracheal_tube_insertion.csv"
The csv file is a clean dataset of 969 rows (patients) and 6 columns:

Tube:
#1 `tube` - "tube ID", internal diameter of the tube (mm) [Included only for the formula-based model; Do not use as a machine-learning model feature]

Model features:
#2 `sex` - patient sex (0=female, 1=male)
#3 `age_c` - patient age (years, rounded to half years)
#4 `ht` - patient height (cm)
#5 `wt` - patient weight (kg)

Target:
#6 `tube_depth_G` - Optimal tracheal tube depth as determined by chest X-ray (in cm)


Here are the first few lines of the file:
```output
tube,sex,age_c,ht,wt,tube_depth_G
3.5,0,0,62.8,6.2,9.7
4,1,0,69,9.1,11
3,1,0,52,3.7,8.6

[5] ----- USER {DataExplorer} -> "Data Exploration Code"  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As part of a data-exploration phase, please write a complete short Python code for getting a first sense of the data.

Your code should create an output text file named "data_exploration.txt", which should contain a summary of the data.

The output file should be self-contained; any results you choose to save to this file should be accompanied with a short header.

The output file should be formatted as follows:

```output
# Data Size
<Measure of the scale of our data (e.g., number of rows, number of columns)>

# Summary Statistics
<Summary statistics of all or key variables>

# Categorical Variables
<As applicable, list here categorical values and their most common values>

# Missing Values
<Counts of missing, unknown, or undefined values>
<As applicable, counts of special numeric values that stand for unknown/undefined if any (check in the "Description of the Dataset" above for any)>

# <title of other summary you deem relevant, if any>
<Add any other summary of the data you deem relevant>

# <etc for any other summary you deem relevant.>
```

If any of the above sections is not applicable, then write "# Not Applicable" under that section.

If needed, you can use the following packages which are already installed:
('pandas', 'numpy', 'scipy')

Do not provide a sketch or pseudocode; write a complete runnable code.
Do not create any graphics, figures or any plots.
Do not send any presumed output examples.

Here is a Python code that will perform this task for you. It is assumed that the "tracheal_tube_insertion.csv" file is in the same directory:


import pandas as pd

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv("tracheal_tube_insertion.csv")

# Open output file
with open('data_exploration.txt', 'w') as f:
    # Data Size
    f.write('# Data Size\n')
    f.write('Number of rows: {}\n'.format(df.shape[0]))
    f.write('Number of columns: {}\n\n'.format(df.shape[1]))
    
    # Summary Statistics
    f.write('# Summary Statistics\n')
    summary = df.describe(include='all') # summary statistics for all variables
    f.write('{}\n\n'.format(summary))
    
    # Categorical Variables
    f.write('# Categorical Variables\n')
    # In this case "sex" is the only categorical variable
    most_common = df['sex'].mode()[0] # Get the most common value
    f.write('Most common value for sex: {}\n\n'.format(most_common))

    # Missing Values
    f.write('# Missing Values\n')
    missing_values = df.isnull().sum() # Counts of missing values for each column
    f.write('{}\n\n'.format(missing_values))
    nan_values = (df == 'Nan').sum() # Counts of 'Nan' values for each column
    f.write('Counts of "Nan" values: {}\n\n'.format(nan_values))
    
f.close()


Just copy the code to a python script or Jupyter notebook and run it.
