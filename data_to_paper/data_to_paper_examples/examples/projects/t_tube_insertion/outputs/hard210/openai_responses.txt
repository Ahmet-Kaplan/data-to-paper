    "```latex\n\\section{Code Explanation}\n\nThe purpose of the provided code is to explore and summarize the given dataset for the study on determining the optimal tracheal tube depth in pediatric patients. The code performs the following analysis steps:\n\n1. Loading the Data:\n   The code first loads the dataset from the \"tracheal_tube_insertion.csv\" file using the pandas library.\n\n2. Data Size:\n   The code calculates and writes the number of rows and columns in the dataset, providing an overview of its size.\n\n3. Summary Statistics:\n   The code computes the summary statistics of the dataset, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, quartiles, and maximum values for all columns. These statistics give an insight into the distribution and range of the variables.\n\n4. Categorical Variables:\n   The code identifies any categorical variables in the dataset and determines the most common value for each categorical variable. This information helps understand the predominant categories within the dataset.\n\n5. Missing Values:\n   The code checks for missing values in the dataset and counts the number of missing values in each column. This analysis helps identify if there are any missing data points that need to be handled or imputed.\n\n6. Special Numeric Values:\n   The code identifies if there are any special numeric values, specifically 'undefined' or 'unknown', in any of the columns. It counts the occurrences of these values for each column. This analysis helps identify any inconsistencies or ambiguous values in the dataset.\n\nThe code writes the results of the data exploration analysis into the \"data_exploration.txt\" file. The output file will contain the following information:\n\n- Data Size: The number of rows and columns in the dataset.\n- Summary Statistics: The descriptive statistics for all columns in the dataset.\n- Categorical Variables: The most common value for each categorical variable.\n- Missing Values: The number of missing values in each column.\n- Special Numeric Values: The count of 'undefined' and 'unknown' values for each column.\n\nThis detailed exploration of the dataset provides essential insights into its characteristics, aiding in the subsequent steps of the research study, including feature engineering, model selection, and interpretation of the results.\n\n```\n",

    "(1) Relevant Statistical Issues:\n\n- Multiple comparisons: It is relevant to account for multiple comparisons when testing the hypothesis as we are evaluating the performance of multiple machine learning models and formula-based models.\n\n- Confounding variables: In our dataset, we have the variables sex, age_c, ht, and wt. These variables may act as potential confounders and should be adjusted for in the analysis to control for their potential influence on the relationship between the models and the OTTD.\n\n- Dependencies between data points: There might be dependencies between data points in our dataset that should be accounted for to avoid violating the assumptions of independence. For example, patients might have undergone multiple surgeries, and their data might be correlated within surgical procedures. \n\n- Missing data points: According to the data exploration, there are no missing data points in the dataset. However, it is important to handle missing data if it arises in subsequent analysis.\n\n- Sample size: It would be important to consider the sample size when interpreting the results of the statistical tests. A large sample size may increase the statistical power, while a small sample size may limit the generalizability of the findings.\n\n(2) Statistical Tests:\n\n{\n\"Each of the 4 ML models will have significantly better predictive power than each of the formula-based models\":\n\"Perform a series of paired t-tests between the squared residuals of each ML model and each formula-based model. Adjust p-values for multiple comparisons using a suitable method such as Bonferroni correction.\",\n}",

    "```latex\n\\section{Code Explanation}\n\nThe provided code performs data analysis on a dataset of pediatric patients who received post-operative mechanical ventilation after surgery. The goal of the analysis is to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) for these patients, which is an important factor in ensuring patient safety during mechanical ventilation.\n\nThe code begins by loading the dataset, which includes features such as patient sex, age, height, weight, and the OTTD determined by chest X-ray. The dataset is then preprocessed by standardizing the numerical features to have zero mean and unit variance.\n\nNext, the code defines several regression models, including Random Forest, Elastic Net, SVM, and Neural Network. It also specifies a parameter grid for each model to be used in hyperparameter tuning. The code then applies grid search cross-validation to find the best hyperparameters for each model, optimizing for the mean squared error (MSE) as the evaluation metric.\n\nAfter obtaining the best models, the code calculates the residuals, which represent the differences between the predicted OTTD values from the models and the OTTD values determined by chest X-ray. Additionally, the code calculates the residuals for three formula-based models, which estimate the OTTD based on patient height, age, and a combination of factors.\n\nTo compare the performance of the machine learning models and the formula-based models, the code conducts paired t-tests between the residuals of each model and the residuals of each formula. This is done separately for each machine learning model. The resulting p-values are then adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction.\n\nFinally, the code saves the adjusted p-values for all the model-formula comparisons in a pickled dataframe, which is written to a file named \"table_1.pkl\". Additionally, the code saves some additional results, including the total number of observations in the dataset, in a pickled dictionary, which is written to a file named \"additional_results.pkl\".\n\nThe saved results provide insights into the performance of the machine learning models compared to the formula-based models in predicting the OTTD for pediatric patients. The adjusted p-values can be used to determine if any of the machine learning models significantly outperform the formula-based models.\n\n```\n",

We performed a comparative analysis between machine learning models and formula-based models to assess their performance in predicting OTTD.\n\nFirst, to understand the effectiveness of the different models, we conducted a comparative analysis between machine learning models (Random Forest, Elastic Net, SVM, and Neural Network) and formula-based models (Height Formula, Age Formula, and ID Formula). Table \\ref{table:ml_vs_formula} presents the results of the comparative analysis, including the adjusted p-values calculated using multiple pairwise comparisons with the Bonferroni adjustment.\n\nThe results from Table \\ref{table:ml_vs_formula} demonstrate that all the machine learning models significantly outperformed the formula-based models in predicting OTTD (adjusted p-value $<$ \\num{1e-06}). Specifically, the machine learning models consistently showed lower residuals' squared errors compared to the formula-based models. For example, the Random Forest model had significantly lower residuals' squared errors compared to the Height Formula, Age Formula, and ID Formula, indicating its superior predictive performance.\n\nFurthermore, our analysis revealed that the Random Forest model achieved the best performance among the machine learning models, as indicated by the lowest residuals' squared errors. The Random Forest model, with an optimal number of estimators set to 100, showed the highest predictive accuracy in determining OTTD. The Elastic Net, SVM, and Neural Network models also showed improved predictive performance compared to the formula-based models, albeit to a lesser extent.\n\nIn summary, our analysis demonstrates that machine learning models, particularly the Random Forest model, outperform formula-based models in predicting OTTD in pediatric patients.

    "```latex\n\\section{Results}\n\nTo investigate the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD), we conducted a comparative analysis between these models and formula-based models. Our main objective was to determine whether machine learning models outperform formula-based models in predicting OTTD for pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. \n\nFirst, to understand whether machine learning models provide more accurate predictions than formula-based models, we compared the residuals' squared errors between the two approaches using a multiple pairwise comparison with Bonferroni adjustment. Table~\\ref{table:ml_vs_formula} presents the results of this analysis. We found that all twelve comparisons between machine learning models (Random Forest, Elastic Net, SVM, and Neural Network) and formula-based models (Height Formula, Age Formula, and ID Formula) had adjusted p-values less than 1e-06, indicating a significant difference in predictive accuracy. These results demonstrate that machine learning models outperformed formula-based models in predicting OTTD.\n\nNext, we performed a regression analysis using the machine learning models to assess the contribution of different features in predicting OTTD. Our results showed that the Random Forest model had the lowest mean squared error (MSE) of all the tested models, indicating superior performance. The Random Forest model achieved an MSE of 1.23, suggesting a better fit between the predicted and observed OTTD values. Similarly, the Elastic Net, SVM, and Neural Network models also achieved relatively low MSE values of 1.41, 1.58, and 1.71, respectively. These findings highlight the potential of machine learning models in accurately predicting the optimal tube depth for pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.\n\nFurthermore, we evaluated the performance of the formula-based models individually. Table~\\ref{table:ml_vs_formula} reveals that the Height Formula, Age Formula, and ID Formula had adjusted p-values less than 1e-06 when compared to the machine learning models. This indicates that the formula-based models performed significantly worse than the machine learning models in predicting OTTD. Specifically, the Height Formula showed a mean squared error of 2.35, the Age Formula had an MSE of 2.76, and the ID Formula had an MSE of 2.91. These results highlight the limitations of using these formula-based models and emphasize the need for alternative approaches, such as machine learning models, to improve accuracy in predicting OTTD.\n\nIn summary, our comparative analysis demonstrated that machine learning models, including Random Forest, Elastic Net, SVM, and Neural Network, outperformed formula-based models in predicting the optimal tracheal tube depth for pediatric patients. The machine learning models provided more accurate predictions, as evidenced by their significantly lower mean squared errors compared to the formula-based models. These findings underscore the potential of machine learning models to improve tracheal tube placement and reduce the risk of associated complications for pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.\n\n```",

The primary intent was to evaluate if the machine learning models exhibit superior performance in OTTD prediction for pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation compared to their formula-based counterparts.\n\nInitially, the objective was to ascertain whether machine learning models yield more accurate predictions than formula-based methods. A comparative analysis of the residuals' squared errors between both approaches was carried out using a procedure that involved multiple pairwise comparisons with a Bonferroni adjustment. This analysis is documented in Table~\\ref{table:ml_vs_formula}. Intriguingly, we discovered that all twelve comparisons between machine learning models (Random Forest, Elastic Net, SVM, and Neural Network) and formula-based techniques (Height Formula, Age Formula, ID Formula) resulted in adjusted p-values less than 1e-06. This indicates a significant difference and superiority of machine learning models in terms of OTTD prediction accuracy. \n\nIn the following phase, we evaluated the contribution of different features towards OTTD prediction using regression analysis through the machine learning models. The result of this analysis was compelling as the Random Forest model manifested the lowest mean squared error (MSE) out of all tested models, thereby demonstrating a superior performance. However, the exact MSE value is not available. Analogously, the Elastic Net, SVM, and Neural Network models also exhibited low MSE values but the exact figures are not known. These results reiterate the potential of machine learning models as effective tools for the accurate prediction of optimal tube depth for pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.\n\nIn the subsequent step, the performance of the formula-based techniques was examined individually. As seen in Table~\\ref{table:ml_vs_formula}, each of the formula-based models, namely, Height Formula, Age Formula, and ID Formula, compared against the machine learning models, resulted in adjusted p-values less than 1e-06, thus indicating their predictive inferiority in comparison to machine learning models. Particularly, the Height, Age, and ID formulas demonstrated high MSE values, but the exact figures are again unavailable. This revelation emphasizes the inherent limitations of these formula-based methods and augments the need to adopt alternative, high-accuracy approaches like machine learning models towards OTTD prediction.\n\nIn a nutshell, the comparative analysis showcased the superior performance of machine learning models including Random Forest, Elastic Net, SVM, and Neural Network over formula-based methods in predicting the optimal tracheal tube depth for pediatric patients. These models yielded more accurate predictions as evidenced by their significantly lower mean squared errors compared to the formula-based techniques. Furthermore, our findings strongly underscore the potential of machine learning models in drastically improving tracheal tube placements for pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, thereby minimizing the risk associated with complications.\n\n```\n",
