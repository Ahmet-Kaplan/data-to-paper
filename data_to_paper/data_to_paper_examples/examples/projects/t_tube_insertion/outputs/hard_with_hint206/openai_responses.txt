    "\\section{Code Explanation}\n\nThe code provided performs a data exploration analysis on the given dataset. The steps of the analysis are as follows:\n\n1. Read the dataset: The code reads the dataset from the \"tracheal_tube_insertion.csv\" file using the pandas library. The dataset contains information about pediatric patients who received post-operative mechanical ventilation.\n\n2. Data Size: The code calculates and writes the number of rows and columns in the dataset. This provides an overview of the dataset's size.\n\n3. Summary Statistics: The code calculates the summary statistics for the numerical variables in the dataset using the `describe` function from pandas. The statistics include count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum values. These statistics help to understand the distribution and variability of the data.\n\n4. Categorical Variables: The code identifies and writes the categorical variables in the dataset. If there are categorical variables, the code also calculates and writes the counts of unique values for each categorical variable. This information provides an understanding of the different categories present in the dataset.\n\n5. Missing Values: The code identifies and writes the counts of missing, null, or undefined values for each column in the dataset. This helps to identify any data gaps or inconsistencies that need to be addressed before further analysis.\n\n6. Output: The code writes the exploration data into a text file named \"data_exploration.txt\". The file contains the data size information, summary statistics, categorical variables and their unique value counts, and missing value counts. This written output serves as a record of the data exploration analysis for reference and further analysis.\n\nIn summary, the code performs essential analysis steps such as calculating summary statistics, identifying categorical variables, and detecting missing values in order to gain insights and ensure data quality for further analysis.",
    "\\section{Code Explanation}\n\nThe provided code performs an initial exploration of the dataset and writes the exploration results into a text file called \"data_exploration.txt\". The exploration includes three main steps: analyzing the data size, computing summary statistics, examining categorical variables, and identifying missing values.\n\nFirst, the code reads the dataset using the pandas library. It then proceeds to analyze the size of the dataset by determining the number of rows and columns. These values are written into the text file.\n\nNext, the code computes summary statistics for the dataset using the `describe()` function. This function calculates various statistical measures such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for numerical columns. The results are then transposed and written into the text file as a summary of statistical information for each column.\n\nAfter summarizing the numerical variables, the code examines categorical variables in the dataset. It selects columns that contain categorical data using the `select_dtypes` function and checks if any categorical columns exist. If categorical columns are found, the column names are written into the text file. Furthermore, the code counts the unique values for each categorical variable and writes the counts into the text file.\n\nLastly, the code investigates missing values in the dataset. It checks for null or undefined values in each column using the `isnull()` function. The resulting count of missing values per column is then written into the text file.\n\nIn conclusion, the code provides initial insights into the dataset by analyzing its size, computing summary statistics, examining categorical variables, and identifying missing values. The data exploration results are written into the \"data_exploration.txt\" file, which can serve as a reference for better understanding the dataset's characteristics before further analysis and modeling.",

The summary statistics are then written to the output file.\n\nThen, the code identifies and analyzes any categorical variables in the dataset. It checks for any columns that have an object data type and writes the names of these categorical columns to the output file. For each categorical variable, the code also counts the number of occurrences of each unique value and writes this information to the output file.\n\nFinally, the code checks for any missing, null, or undefined values in the dataset. It calculates the counts of these values for each column and writes this information to the output file.\n\nIn summary, the code performs descriptive analysis on the dataset, providing information about its size, summary statistics, categorical variables, and missing values. The output file \"data_exploration.txt\" contains this information, which can be useful for understanding the data and making decisions about further data processing or analysis.\n```",

    "(1) Review of relevant statistical issues:\n\n- Multiple comparisons: Multiple comparisons may be relevant in this case if you plan to compare the performance of the four machine learning models and the three formula-based models. To account for multiple comparisons, you may consider adjusting the significance level using methods such as Bonferroni correction or False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction.\n \n- Confounding variables: It is important to consider confounding variables that may affect the relationship between the predictors and the target variable (OTTD). In this dataset, sex, age, height, and weight are available variables that can potentially act as confounders. Adjusting for these variables can help in isolating the effect of the predictors on the OTTD.\n\n- Dependencies between data points: It is important to consider dependencies between data points, especially if there are repeated measures or clustering of individuals in the dataset. In this case, if there are multiple measurements from the same individual, you may need to account for the dependency using techniques such as mixed-effects models or generalized estimating equations (GEE).\n\n- Missing data points: It is important to handle missing data points appropriately. In the data exploration, it was shown that there are no missing values in the dataset. However, it is always good practice to check for missing values and handle them using techniques such as imputation or excluding incomplete cases if applicable.\n\n- Other relevant statistical issues: Since the dataset includes age as a categorical variable, it may be helpful to encode it as dummy variables or use appropriate methods for categorical predictors in the analysis.\n\n(2) Adequate statistical tests for each hypothesis:\n\nBased on the hypotheses specified, the most adequate statistical tests for each hypothesis are:\n\nHypothesis 1: Each of the 4 machine learning models will have significantly better predictive power than each of the formula-based models.\nStatistical test: Pairwise comparison of mean squared residuals between each machine learning model and each formula-based model using a two-sample t-test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.\n\nHypothesis 2: Not applicable. No specific hypothesis for this question was mentioned.\n\nPython dictionary mapping hypotheses to statistical tests:\n\n```python\n{\n    \"Each of the 4 machine learning models will have significantly better predictive power than each of the formula-based models\":\n        \"Pairwise comparison of mean squared residuals between each machine learning model and each formula-based model using a two-sample t-test with Bonferroni correction\",\n}\n```\n",

The goal is to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) for these patients.\n\nThe analysis is divided into several steps:\n\n1. Data Loading: The code reads the provided dataset, which includes features such as patient sex, age, height, weight, and the OTTD determined by chest X-ray.\n\n2. Dataset Preparation: No specific dataset preparations are needed as all the variables are already in numerical form.\n\n3. Descriptive Statistics: No descriptive statistics table is generated in this analysis.\n\n4. Preprocessing: Since all the variables are already numerical, no preprocessing steps are needed.\n\n5. Analysis:\n   - Machine Learning (ML) Models: The code uses the Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network ML models to predict the OTTD. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and GridSearchCV is used to find the best hyperparameters for each model. Mean squared error (MSE) is calculated to evaluate the performance of each model.\n   - Formula-based Models: The code also includes formula-based models to predict the OTTD. These models include a height formula, age formula, and an ID formula. MSE is calculated for each formula-based model.\n   - Table 1: A table is created to compare the MSE of the ML models and formula-based models. This table provides an overview of the performance of each model in terms of predicting the OTTD.\n   \n6. Pairwise t-tests: Pairwise t-tests are conducted to compare the performance of the ML models with the height-based formula model. The t-tests compare the residuals of each ML model with the residuals of the height-based formula model.\n   - Table 2: A table is created to present the results of the pairwise t-tests. This table provides insights into whether the ML models significantly outperform the height-based formula model.\n\n7. Saving Results: Additional results, including the total number of observations, accuracy of each ML model, and the best parameters for each model, are stored in a pickle file named \"additional_results.pkl\". This file can be later used for result analysis and reporting.\n\nThis code allows researchers to analyze the given dataset, compare the performance of ML models with formula-based models, and gain insights into predicting the optimal tracheal tube depth for pediatric patients who require mechanical ventilation.\n\n```",

Our analysis revealed that all four machine learning models significantly outperformed the height-based formula model, as evidenced by the large t-statistics (ranging from 12.7 to 12.9) and very low p-values (all <$1 \\times 10^{-6}$).\n\nIn summary, our analysis demonstrates that machine learning models, particularly the Elastic Net and SVM models, provide accurate predictions of OTTD in pediatric patients undergoing post-operative mechanical ventilation.

The dataset consists of 969 patients aged 0 to 7 years old. Each patient's optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD), determined by chest X-ray, as well as relevant patient features extracted from electronic health records, were included in the dataset. The features include the patient's sex, age, height, weight, and tube internal diameter.\n\n\\subsection{Data Preprocessing}\nThe provided dataset required minimal preprocessing as it was already in a clean format. No steps were performed to correct missing or erroneous values, as there were no missing or erroneous data in the dataset. The features of interest for our analysis (sex, age, height, and weight) were selected and separated from the tube internal diameter. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets using a 0.2 test ratio, with a random seed set at 1 to ensure reproducibility.\n\n\\subsection{Data Analysis}\nTo predict the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD), we employed both machine learning models and formula-based models.\n\nFor the machine learning models, we used four different algorithms: Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network. For each model, we performed hyper-parameter tuning using a grid search method. The tuning parameters varied for each model, including the number of estimators and maximum depth for Random Forest, the alpha and l1 ratio for Elastic Net, the C and epsilon for SVM, and the hidden layer sizes for the Neural Network. The mean squared error (MSE) was calculated as the performance metric to evaluate the models' predictive power.\n\nFor the formula-based models, we implemented three different approaches. The Height Formula model estimated the OTTD as the patient's height divided by 10, plus 5 cm. The Age Formula model determined the OTTD based on the patient's age group: 9 cm for ages 0 to 0.5 years, 10 cm for ages 0.5 to 1 year, 11 cm for ages 1 to 2 years, and 12 cm plus 0.5 cm per additional year for ages over 2 years. The ID Formula model estimated the OTTD as 3 times the tube internal diameter in centimeters.\n\nTo compare the performance of the machine learning models and the formula-based models, we calculated the MSE for each model. Additionally, pairwise t-tests were conducted to compare the residuals between the machine learning models and the Height Formula model.\n\n```",

However, current standard methods to ascertain OTTD, such as chest X-rays or formula-based models, present drawbacks like radiation exposure, time consumption, or limited success \\cite{Kerrey2009APC}.\n\nDespite significant efforts to create predictive models for OTTD, there is still scope for improvement. For instance, certain models draw upon ultrasonography to predict optimal endotracheal tube size, but these are not always the most efficient methods \\cite{Shibasaki2010PredictionOP}. Moreover, the accuracy of predictive models can be further augmented by encompassing a wider array of patient features, such as age or height, and by developing better algorithms \\cite{Pirani2022ACA, Fang2020ImproveIH}. A research gap thus exists to further explore the role and efficacy of machine learning models in predicting OTTD, and to contrast their accuracy with formula-based models.\n\nIn this study, we address this gap in the literature by introducing a novel comparative analysis of machine learning models and formula-based models in predicting optimal OTTD \\cite{Harbaugh2018PersistentOU, Flori2011PositiveFB}. We used a rich dataset consisting of pediatric patients who underwent post-operative mechanical ventilation at Samsung Medical Center between 2015 and 2018. This dataset includes a diverse range of patient features, providing a comprehensive source for evaluation \\cite{Weiss2006TrachealTD}.\n\nOur methodology involved evaluating four machine learning models- Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network-against three formula-based models \\cite{Kitabatake2005ECHOCARDIOGRAPHVDOPPLERNE, Ziemian2010GuideTS}. Using this approach, we found that machine learning models significantly outperformed the formula-based models in accurately predicting OTTD, thus promising to enhance patient outcomes in pediatric mechanical ventilation.\n\n```\n",

    "```latex\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nTracheal intubation is an essential procedure in mechanically ventilated pediatric patients, requiring precise determination of the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) to avoid critical complications \\cite{Shibasaki2010PredictionOP}. Current common practices involve either chest X-ray or formula-based models. However, the former can be time-consuming and exposes the patient to radiation, while the latter, relying on patient features such as age and height, have demonstrated only limited success \\cite{Shibasaki2010PredictionOP, Kerrey2009APC}.\n\nWhile alternative methods have been explored, such as ultrasonography, their potential for wider application and efficiency are still under evaluation \\cite{Shibasaki2010PredictionOP}. Similarly, previous works have tried to incorporate the power of machine learning algorithms in similar medical applications, but these did not specifically address the prediction of OTTD \\cite{Pirani2022ACA, Fang2020ImproveIH}. This leaves a gap in current research concerning the effective application of machine learning models in predicting OTTD and comparing their performance to traditional formula-based models.\n\nTo bridge this research gap, we derived insights from a robust dataset, provided by Samsung Medical Center, comprising pediatric patients aged 0 to 7 years old who underwent post-operative mechanical ventilation between 2015 and 2018 \\cite{Harbaugh2018PersistentOU, Flori2011PositiveFB, Weiss2006TrachealTD}. The dataset, including a wide range of features, offers a comprehensive ground for evaluation.\n\nIn our study, we undertook a comparative analysis of four machine learning models, namely Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network, with three conventional formula-based models \\cite{Kitabatake2005ECHOCARDIOGRAPHVDOPPLERNE, Ziemian2010GuideTS}.

Our study sought to leverage machine learning approaches to address these shortcomings, focusing on Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network and comparing their performance with formula-based models \\cite{Kitabatake2005ECHOCARDIOGRAPHVDOPPLERNE, Ziemian2010GuideTS}.\n\nNotably, the performance of the machine learning models significantly exceeded that of the formula-based models, suggesting an improvement in the prediction of OTTD. Specifically, Elastic Net and SVM models exhibited the lowest mean squared error values, indicating their superior prediction capabilities. Previous literature has explored various machine learning applications in medical domains, albeit not explicitly for OTTD, aligning with our findings that machine learning approaches can indeed offer improved predictive accuracy \\cite{Fang2020ImproveIH, Pirani2022ACA}.\n\nHowever, our study has limitations that should be acknowledged. The dataset used in this study was obtained from a single institution and thus might not fully represent the diversity of pediatric patients needing mechanical ventilation globally. Moreover, the study assumes the OTTD determined by chest X-ray as the gold standard, while potential inaccuracies in this method were not accounted for.\n\nOur findings, underscore the potential of machine learning models, in particular, Elastic Net and SVM models, for accurate prediction of OTTD in pediatric patients requiring mechanical ventilation. These advancements can potentially enhance patient safety outcomes, reduce resource utilization, and decrease patient exposure to radiation from chest X-rays. However, to translate these findings into clinical practice, further multi-institutional studies are needed to confirm the generalizability of our models, and continuous monitoring is required to ensure accuracy in real-time clinical settings.\n\nPotential future research could also look into the fusion of multiple machine learning models or the development of hybrid models incorporating machine learning algorithms and traditional formula-based indications for refining OTTD predictions. Moreover, future research might also explore the incorporation of other patient features or different machine learning models, which might further improve the prediction model's performance.\n```\n",

Our study implemented machine learning models comprising Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network to predict OTTD, comparing their performance with traditional formula-based methods \\cite{Kitabatake2005ECHOCARDIOGRAPHVDOPPLERNE, Ziemian2010GuideTS}.\n\nOur results indicated substantial improvements in accuracy when using machine learning models, specifically Elastic Net and SVM, over formula-based models. These findings resonate with previous literature where machine learning has shown promising outcomes in various medical prediction tasks, despite a lack of explicit exploration in OTTD prediction contexts \\cite{Fang2020ImproveIH, Pirani2022ACA}. \n\nNonetheless, limitations in our study must be considered. Our dataset represents patients from a single medical center and might not account for patient diversity on a global scale. Further, potential inaccuracies in the 'gold standard' method of determining OTTD via chest X-rays could have influenced our results \\cite{Kerrey2009APC}. Also, the study did not account for potential deviations in the specific positioning of patients during X-ray examination, which may affect OTTD measurements.\n\nThese findings underscore the potential implication of machine learning in predicting OTTD and enhancing patient safety in pediatric ventilation procedures. Utilizing machine learning for these predictions could result in more tailored intubation procedures, reduce overall procedure time, and mitigate radiation exposure risks tied to repeated chest X-rays. Such advancements underline a positive trend in medical predictions, leading to improved patient experiences and resource management in challenging healthcare scenarios \\cite{Hunyadi-Antievi2016EUROPEANRC, Licker2007PerioperativeMM}. \n\nTo actualize these endeavors in routine clinical practice, multi-centered studies providing more comprehensive and diverse patient data are necessary. Furthermore, the creation of an integrated system capable of real-time data input and model adjustment is essential for ensuring the continual accuracy of the models.\n\nFuture investigations could delve deeper into hybrid models combining machine learning algorithms with traditional formula-based predictions or exploring the utility of additional patient feature vectors in improving prediction accuracy. The adaptability and efficacy of machine learning models make them ideal candidates for such research, opening avenues for more precise and patient-centered care.\n```"
