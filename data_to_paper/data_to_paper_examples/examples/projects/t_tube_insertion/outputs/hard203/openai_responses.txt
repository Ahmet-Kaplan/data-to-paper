Data Size: It writes the number of rows and columns present in the dataset.\n\n2. Summary Statistics: It calculates and writes the summary statistics for each column in the dataset. This includes count, unique values, top value, and frequency for categorical variables, and mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartile information for numerical variables.\n\n3. Categorical Variables: It identifies the categorical variables in the dataset and writes the most common value for each categorical variable.

If there are no missing values, it writes a message stating that there are none.\n\nThe code saves all the analysis results in the \"data_exploration.txt\" file, providing a comprehensive overview of the dataset.

    "(1) Review of Relevant Statistical Issues:\n\n- Multiple Comparisons:\n  - Multiple comparisons are not relevant in this case as we are comparing the predictive power of different models and formula-based approaches. Each model or approach will be evaluated individually, so there is no need to adjust for multiple comparisons.\n\n- Confounding Variables:\n  - Confounding variables can be relevant in this case as they may affect the relation between the predictors (age, sex, height, weight) and the OTTD. In the dataset, the available variables that we can adjust for are sex, age, height, and weight.\n\n- Dependencies between Data Points:\n  - As the dataset represents individual patients, there may be potential dependencies between data points, especially if there are repeated measurements. However, based on the current information, it is assumed that the data points are independent.\n\n- Missing Data Points:\n  - According to the data exploration output, there are no missing values in the dataset. Therefore, missing data points are not a relevant statistical issue in this case.\n\n- Other Relevant Statistical Issues:\n  - One important statistical issue to consider is the need for hyper-parameter tuning for the machine learning models. This is necessary to optimize the models' performance and avoid overfitting.\n\n(2) Mapping of Hypotheses to Statistical Tests:\n\n{\n  \"Each of the 4 machine learning models will have significantly better predictive power than each of the formula-based models\":\n  \"Paired t-test comparing the squared residuals of each machine learning model with the squared residuals of each formula-based model, while adjusting for confounding variables (sex, age, height, weight)\",\n\n  \"(Additional hypothesis) The predictive power of the Random Forest model will be significantly better than that of the other machine learning models\":\n  \"Repeated measures ANOVA comparing the squared residuals of the machine learning models (RF, EN, SVM, NN), with RF as the within-subjects factor, while adjusting for confounding variables (sex, age, height, weight)\",\n\n  \"(Additional hypothesis) The formula-based models will have significantly different predictive power from each other\":\n  \"Repeated measures ANOVA comparing the squared residuals of the formula-based models (Height, Age, ID), while adjusting for confounding variables (sex, age, height, weight)\"\n}\n\nNote: The above suggestions assume that the squared residuals of the models' predictions will be used as the evaluation metric.",

The goal is to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) for these patients in a non-invasive and efficient manner.\n\nThe code begins by importing the necessary libraries for data analysis and model training. It then loads the dataset which contains information about patient sex, age, height, weight, and the OTTD determined by chest X-ray.\n\nAfter loading the dataset, the code prepares the data for analysis. It splits the data into feature variables (X) and the target variable (y), and then splits the data into training and testing sets. The features are scaled using standardization to ensure comparable ranges.\n\nNext, the code performs the analysis using different machine learning models and formula-based methods. The machine learning models include Elastic Net, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network. The code fits each model on the training data and evaluates their performance by predicting the OTTD on the test data. The mean squared error is calculated as a measure of performance. \n\nAdditionally, the code includes formula-based methods that estimate the OTTD based on patient height, age, and weight. The mean squared error is calculated for each formula-based method. The code then compares the performance of each machine learning model with the formula-based methods using a t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in performance.\n\nThe code saves the results of the analysis in two pickle files. \"table_0.pkl\" contains descriptive statistics of the patient's sex, age, height, weight, and the OTTD. \"table_1.pkl\" includes the performance comparison among the machine learning models and formula-based methods, including the squared residues and the p-values from the t-test.\n\nFinally, the code saves additional results in the \"additional_results.pkl\" file. This includes the total number of observations in the dataset and the total number of observations used for testing.\n\nOverall, the code performs a comprehensive analysis to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth using machine learning models and formula-based methods, providing insights into the performance of different approaches in a non-invasive manner.\n```\n",

The current gold standard for determining OTTD through chest X-ray is time-consuming and exposes patients to radiation. Existing formula-based models have had limited success in accurately predicting OTTD. In this study, we present a novel machine learning approach to estimate OTTD in pediatric patients aged 0-7 years. Our dataset comprises patient features extracted from electronic health records, such as age, height, and weight, along with the OTTD determined by chest X-ray. We employed various machine learning models, including Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network, along with formula-based models for comparison. Our results demonstrate that the machine learning models outperformed the formula-based models in estimating OTTD, as evidenced by significantly lower squared residues. We also observed that the machine learning models achieved higher accuracy in predicting OTTD than the formula-based models, as indicated by the p-values from the t-test analysis. These findings suggest that our machine learning approach holds promise for accurately determining OTTD in pediatric patients, potentially reducing the risks associated with tracheal tube misplacement. However, further validation and refinement of the models are needed before they can be implemented in clinical practice.
