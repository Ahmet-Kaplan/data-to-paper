\title{Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth Prediction in Pediatric Patients using Machine Learning}
\author{Data to Paper}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Mechanical ventilation in pediatric patients requires accurate positioning of the tracheal tube. However, determining the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (OTTD) is challenging and time-consuming. This study addresses the research gap by developing a machine learning approach to predict the OTTD in pediatric patients. We analyzed a dataset of 969 patients aged 0-7 years who underwent post-operative mechanical ventilation. By comparing the performance with a formula-based model, our Random Forest machine learning model achieved a significantly lower mean squared error (MSE) of 1.04. The analysis of residuals further validated the superior prediction accuracy of our model. These findings have important implications for improving patient outcomes and provide a reliable and efficient method for tracheal tube placement in pediatric patients. 
\end{abstract}
\section*{Results}

In this section, we present the results of our analysis, which aimed to develop a machine learning approach to predict the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (OTTD) in pediatric patients. We conducted multiple analyses comparing the performance of the machine-learning model with a formula-based model using different metrics.

We analyzed the descriptive statistics of OTTD stratified by sex to understand any potential differences. The mean OTTD was 10.1 cm (SD: 1.65) for females and 10.3 cm (SD: 1.86) for males, as shown in Table {}\ref{table:statistics_by_sex}. Although there is a slight difference in mean OTTD between females and males, the clinical significance of this difference requires further investigation.

\item \textbf{Standard Deviation}: Standard Deviation of OTTD (cm)
\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}


To evaluate the prediction accuracy of our machine-learning model, we compared it with the formula-based model using mean squared error (MSE). The machine-learning model, using the Random Forest algorithm, achieved a significantly lower MSE of 1.04 compared to the formula-based model with an MSE of 3.76, as shown in Table {}\ref{table:performance_model}. This indicates that the machine-learning model provides more accurate predictions of OTTD compared to the formula-based model, which relies on patient features such as age and height.

\end{tabular}}
\begin{tablenotes}
\footnotesize
\item \textbf{Mean Squared Error}: Mean Squared Error of the model
\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}


We examined the residuals of the machine-learning model and the formula-based model to further validate their prediction accuracy. The machine-learning model had a mean residual of -0.000822, while the formula-based model had a mean residual of -1.41. The Wilcoxon test confirmed a statistically significant difference (p-value $<$ $10^{-6}$) in residuals between the two models, suggesting that the machine-learning model outperforms the formula-based model in predicting tracheal tube depth, as presented in Table {}\ref{table:comparison_model}. It is important to note that the mean residuals being close to zero does not necessarily indicate good prediction accuracy. Rather, it suggests that, on average, the model predictions are close to the actual OTTD values.

\end{table}


The analysis was conducted on a dataset of 969 pediatric patients who underwent post-operative mechanical ventilation. These results provide valuable insights into the prediction of OTTD in pediatric patients. Further validation and prospective studies are necessary to confirm and generalize our findings. Additionally, the clinical implications of the difference in mean OTTD between males and females require deeper investigation.

In summary, our findings demonstrate that the machine-learning model, based on the Random Forest algorithm, outperforms the formula-based model in predicting the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth in pediatric patients. The machine-learning model achieved a lower mean squared error and demonstrated superior prediction accuracy, as evidenced by the comparison of residuals in our analysis. These results have important implications for improving patient outcomes by providing a reliable and efficient method for tracheal tube placement in pediatric patients. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore their clinical significance in larger cohorts of patients.

\section{Data Description} \label{sec:data_description} Here is the data description, as provided by the user:

\begin{Verbatim}[tabsize=4]
Rationale: Pediatric patients have a shorter tracheal length than adults;
	therefore, the safety margin for tracheal tube tip positioning is narrow.
Indeed, the tracheal tube tip is misplaced in 35%â€“50% of pediatric patients and
	can cause hypoxia, atelectasis, hypercarbia, pneumothorax, and even death.
Therefore, in pediatric patients who require mechanical ventilation, it is
	crucial to determine the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (defined here as `OTTD`,
	not an official term).

Note: For brevity, we introduce the term `OTTD` to refer to the "optimal
	tracheal tube depth". This is not an official term that can be found in the
	literature.

Existing methods: The gold standard to determine OTTD is by chest X-ray, which
	is time-consuming and requires radiation exposure.
Alternatively, formula-based models on patient features such as age and height
	are used to determine OTTD, but with limited success.

The provided dataset focus on patients aged 0-7 year old who received post-
	operative mechanical ventilation after undergoing surgery at Samsung Medical
	Center between January 2015 and December 2018.
For each of these patients, the dataset provides the OTTD determined by chest
	X-ray as well as features extracted from patient electronic health records.


1 data file:

"tracheal_tube_insertion.csv"
The csv file is a clean dataset of 969 rows (patients) and 6 columns:

Tube:
#1 `tube` - "tube ID", internal diameter of the tube (mm) [Included only for the
	formula-based model; Do not use as a machine-learning model feature]

Model features:
#2 `sex` - patient sex (0=female, 1=male)
#3 `age_c` - patient age (years, rounded to half years)
#4 `ht` - patient height (cm)
#5 `wt` - patient weight (kg)

Target:
#6 `tube_depth_G` - Optimal tracheal tube depth as determined by chest X-ray (in
	cm)



\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Code Description}

The code performs a data analysis on a dataset of pediatric patients who underwent post-operative mechanical ventilation. The aim is to determine the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (OTTD) for these patients using two different approaches: a machine-learning model (Random Forest) and a formula-based model.

First, the code loads the dataset and performs some initial data preparations. Descriptive statistics of the tracheal tube depth stratified by sex are then calculated and stored in a pickle file named "table\_0.pkl".

Next, the code preprocesses the data by creating dummy variables for the categorical variable 'sex'.

The code then proceeds to the analysis. It trains a Random Forest regressor using grid search for parameter tuning to predict the tracheal tube depth based on patient features: sex, age, height, and weight. The best hyperparameters are selected based on the mean squared error (MSE) as the evaluation metric.

The prediction results from the Random Forest model and a formula-based model (using a simple equation involving patient height) are compared in terms of MSE. The comparison is stored in a DataFrame named "df1" and saved as "table\_1.pkl".

Additionally, the code calculates the residuals (the differences between the actual tracheal tube depth and the predicted values) for both models. The residuals are then subjected to a paired Wilcoxon test to compare the performance of the two models. The mean residuals and p-value from the Wilcoxon test are stored in a DataFrame named "df2" and saved as "table\_2.pkl".

Finally, the code saves additional results, including the total number of observations in the dataset and the best parameters found for the Random Forest model, in a pickle file named "additional\_results.pkl".

In summary, this code performs a data analysis to determine the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth for pediatric patients using both a machine-learning model and a formula-based model. It compares the performance of these models and provides additional results for further analysis.
