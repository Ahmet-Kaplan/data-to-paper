    "```latex\n\\section{Code Explanation}\n\nThe provided Data Exploration code performs various analysis steps on the dataset and writes the results into the \"data_exploration.txt\" file. The key analysis steps are as follows:\n\n1. Data Size: The code first calculates the number of rows and columns in the dataset using the shape() function of pandas. The results are then written into the output file.\n\n2. Summary Statistics: The code uses the describe() function of pandas to generate summary statistics for each numerical column in the dataset. This includes measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles. The summary statistics are then written into the output file.\n\n3. Categorical Variables: The code identifies the categorical variable \"Sex\" and determines the most common value of this variable using the value_counts() function of pandas. The most common value is then written into the output file.\n\n4. Missing Values: The code checks for missing values in the dataset using the isna() function of pandas. It then counts the number of missing values for each column using the sum() function. The results are written into the output file.\n\n5. Special Numeric Values: The code checks for special numeric values that may stand for unknown or undefined values, such as NaN (not a number) or infinity. It uses the isin() function of pandas to check for these values, and then counts the occurrences using the sum() function. The results are written into the output file.\n\nThe \"data_exploration.txt\" file will contain the following information:\n- Number of rows and columns in the dataset.\n- Summary statistics for each numerical column in the dataset.\n- The most common value of the categorical variable \"Sex\".\n- The number of missing values for each column.\n- The number of occurrences of special numeric values for each column.\n\nThese analysis steps provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, including its size, distribution of numerical variables, presence of missing values, and occurrence of special numeric values. This information is crucial for further data processing and modeling.\n```\n",

    "Relevant Statistical Issues:\n\n1. Multiple Comparisons: We need to consider the issue of multiple comparisons when interpreting the results of our hypothesis testing. Since we are testing two different formula-based models, we need to account for the possibility of inflated type I error rate. This can be addressed using appropriate multiple comparison correction methods such as Bonferroni correction or False Discovery Rate (FDR) control.\n\n2. Confounding Variables: It is important to consider potential confounding variables that may affect the relationship between the formula-based models and the optimal tracheal tube depth. In this dataset, we have several variables that can potentially confound this relationship, such as sex, age, height, and weight. It is advisable to adjust for these variables in our statistical analysis to minimize confounding effects.\n\n3. Dependencies between Data Points: There might be dependencies between the data points in our dataset. For example, patients in the same hospital might have similar characteristics or treatment methods. This potential clustering or correlation between data points should be taken into account when performing statistical analysis, such as using appropriate statistical techniques like mixed-effects models or generalized estimating equations (GEE) to account for the dependencies.\n\n4. Missing Data Points: It is crucial to assess the presence of missing data points in our dataset. Missing data can introduce bias and reduce the sample size, affecting the validity of our statistical analysis. We should identify the variables with missing data, evaluate the patterns of missingness, and apply appropriate missing data techniques such as imputation or handling missingness through regression models.\n\n5. Other Relevant Statistical Issues: One relevant statistical issue is the choice of the appropriate statistical test to compare the predictive power of the two formula-based models. We need to select a suitable test that can evaluate the difference in their squared residuals on the same test set and determine if the difference is statistically significant.\n\nStatistical Test Dictionary:\n\n{\n  \"The two formula-based models will significantly differ in their predictive power (as measured by their squared residuals on the same test set)\":\n  \"Paired t-test, comparing the squared residuals of the two formula-based models on the same test set, with adjustment for potential confounding variables like sex, age, height, and weight. Additionally, apply multiple comparison correction (e.g., Bonferroni correction) to account for the issue of multiple comparisons.\"\n}\n\nPlease note that this is a suggested approach based on the hypotheses and dataset provided. The actual statistical analysis and tests may vary depending on the specific requirements and characteristics of the dataset. It is essential to consult with a statistician to ensure the most appropriate statistical methods are applied in the analysis.",

The goal is to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) for these patients.\n\nFirst, the code loads the dataset and prepares it for analysis. There is no preprocessing required as the data is already clean.\n\nNext, descriptive statistics of height and age are calculated, stratified by sex. These statistics are then saved in a pickle file named \"table_0.pkl\".\n\nThe code then proceeds to analyze the data. Two formula-based models are used to predict OTTD: a height model and an age model. For the height model, the patient's height is divided by 10 and added to 5. For the age model, specific age categories are defined and OTTD is calculated based on the age category. The mean squared residuals (MSR) are computed for both models, quantifying the prediction accuracy. These results are saved in a pickle file named \"table_1.pkl\".\n\nA paired t-test is then performed on the residuals between the actual OTTD measurements and the predictions from the height and age models. The test compares the difference between the residuals of the two models. The results of this test, including the t-statistic and p-value, are saved in a dictionary and written to a pickle file named \"additional_results.pkl\".\n\nOverall, the code analyzes the dataset by calculating descriptive statistics, evaluating formula-based models, and performing statistical tests to determine the accuracy of the models.

The objective is to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) necessary for mechanical ventilation - which is typically verified through a chest X-ray, but due to the potential complications this process may cause, computational models that can estimate the OTTD become valuable tools. \n\nThe analysis starts by loading and inspecting the data. Firstly, the code calculates and stores descriptive statistics of age and height, stratified by sex (Table 0: \"Descriptive statistics of height and age stratified by sex\"). \n\nNext, the code constructs two estimations of OTTD: First, a height-based model where OTTD is decided based on a simple formula related to patient's height. The second is an age-based model where OTTD is determined by a piecewise function of the patient's age. \n\nFor both the height and age model, mean squared residuals (the gaps between actual OTTD, as visible from the X-Ray, and OTTD predicted by the model) are calculated and saved in Table 1: \"Comparison of actual OTTD measurements and predictions from the height and age models\". This table allows us to compare the effectiveness of the height model versus the age model on predicting the actual OTTD.\n\nFinally, a paired t-test is performed on the residuals of the height and age model to determine if there are significant differences between these two approaches. \n\nThese results, along with the total number of observations in the data, are then saved into an external \"additional\\_results.pkl\" file for future reference and potential further analysis. The t-test results provide statistical evidence on whether one model clearly outperforms the other.\n\nPlease note that this code is designed to handle clean data and might not work as expected with missing or categorically-encoded variables.\n```\n",

This study aims to address this problem by developing a formula-based model to predict the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD), thus minimizing the risk of incorrect placement. The dataset used in this study consists of patients aged 0-7 years who received post-operative mechanical ventilation at Samsung Medical Center.

Our approach incorporates patient height and age as predictors for OTTD prediction. The developed formula-based models are compared to the actual OTTD measurements, and the mean squared residuals are calculated for evaluation. The results indicate that the age-based formula model outperforms the height-based model in predicting OTTD in pediatric patients. However, it should be noted that both formula-based models have limitations and should be carefully applied in clinical practice. This study provides valuable insights into optimizing tracheal tube depth determination, offering a potential solution to reducing complications associated with misplacement in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.

The dataset used in this analysis consisted of 969 pediatric patients aged 0-7 years who underwent surgery and required post-operative mechanical ventilation. \n\nFirst, we examined the descriptive statistics of height and age stratified by sex (Table \\ref{table:descriptive_statistics}). The mean height was 65.4 cm for female patients and 66.5 cm for male patients, while the mean age was 0.732 years for females and 0.781 years for males. The standard deviations for height and age were 18.7 cm and 1.4 years for female patients, and 19.4 cm and 1.47 years for male patients, respectively. These findings provide insights into the patient characteristics and serve as a basis for further analysis.\n\nNext, we compared the actual OTTD measurements determined by chest X-ray with predictions from our formula-based models. We developed two models: a height-based OTTD prediction model and an age-based OTTD prediction model. The mean squared residuals (MSR) were used as a measure of model performance. The height-based model had an MSR of 3.76, while the age-based model had an MSR of 2.05 (Table \\ref{table:comparison_ottd_models}). These results suggest that the age-based model outperforms the height-based model in predicting the optimal tracheal tube depth in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.\n\nWe further performed a paired t-test on the residuals of the two models to assess the significance of the difference between the models. The paired t-test revealed a statistically significant difference between the residuals of the height-based and age-based models, with a t-statistic of -61.39 (p-value $<$ 1e-6). This indicates that the age-based model is superior to the height-based model in accurately predicting the optimal tracheal tube depth.\n\nIn summary, our analysis demonstrates that the age-based formula model outperforms the height-based model in predicting the optimal tracheal tube depth in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. The descriptive statistics provide insights into the patient characteristics, while the comparison of the formula-based models shows the superiority of the age-based model. These results highlight the potential of formula-based models as a practical alternative to chest X-ray in determining the optimal tracheal tube depth, thereby minimizing the risks associated with tracheal tube misplacement in pediatric patients.\n\n```",
