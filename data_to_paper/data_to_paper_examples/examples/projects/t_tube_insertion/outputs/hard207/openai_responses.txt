    "```latex\n\\section{Code Explanation}\n\nThe code performs data exploration on the provided tracheal tube insertion dataset. It aims to provide a summary of the dataset by calculating summary statistics, exploring categorical variables, and identifying missing values.\n\nFirst, the code reads the dataset into a pandas dataframe for further analysis.\n\nNext, the code calculates and writes the data size to the output file, including the number of rows and columns in the dataset.\n\nTo provide summary statistics, the code selects numeric columns from the dataset and calculates the mean and standard deviation for each column. These summary statistics help understand the central tendency and spread of the numeric variables.\n\nThen, the code identifies categorical variables in the dataset and writes the most common values for each categorical variable. This provides insights into the distribution and frequency of categorical variables.\n\nAfter that, the code checks for missing values in the dataset and writes the counts of missing, unknown, or undefined values for each column. This helps identify any missing data that might require further attention.\n\nFinally, the code closes the output file, completing the data exploration process.\n\nThe output file, \"data_exploration.txt\", contains the following information:\n- Data size: number of rows and columns in the dataset.\n- Summary statistics: mean and standard deviation for each numeric variable.\n- Categorical variables: most common values for each categorical variable.\n- Missing values: counts of missing, unknown, or undefined values for each column.\n\nThe information provided in the output file can be used to gain a better understanding of the dataset, identify potential issues with missing values, and guide further analysis or preprocessing steps in a research study.\n```\n",

    "(1) Bullet-point review of relevant statistical issues:\n\n- Multiple comparisons: Since we are testing multiple machine learning models and formula-based models, there is a potential for multiple comparisons. We need to account for this by adjusting the significance level or using appropriate correction methods such as Bonferroni correction or False Discovery Rate (FDR) control.\n\n- Confounding variables: The dataset includes variables such as sex, age, height, and weight. These variables may act as confounders as they are associated with both the predictor variables and the target variable. We can adjust for these confounders by including them as covariates in the machine learning models or controlling for them in the formula-based models.\n\n- Dependencies between data points: The dataset does not provide information about the dependencies between the data points. If there are dependencies present, such as repeated measures or clustering, appropriate statistical methods such as mixed-effects models or cluster-adjusted standard errors may need to be employed.\n\n- Missing data points: The data exploration code does not indicate the presence of missing data points. However, it is important to verify if there are any missing data points and handle them appropriately before conducting the statistical tests. This may involve imputation techniques or excluding incomplete cases from the analyses.\n\n- Other relevant statistical issues: Other potential statistical issues to consider include model assumptions (e.g., linearity, normality, and homoscedasticity), model selection criteria, and the choice of hyperparameter tuning methods for the machine learning models.\n\n(2) Python dictionary mapping each hypothesis to the most adequate statistical test:\n\n{\n  \"Each of the 4 ML models will have significantly better predictive power than each of the formula-based models\":\n  \"Paired t-test to compare the squared residuals (accuracy metrics) of the ML models and formula-based models on the same test set, accounting for multiple comparisons\",\n\n  \"The predictive power of the RF model is not significantly different from the other ML models\":\n  \"One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test to compare the squared residuals (accuracy metrics) of the RF model with the other ML models, accounting for multiple comparisons\",\n\n  \"Each of the formula-based models will have significantly worse predictive power than the ML models\":\n  \"Paired t-test to compare the squared residuals (accuracy metrics) of the ML models and formula-based models on the same test set, accounting for multiple comparisons\"\n}\n\nNote: The statistical tests suggested above assume that the assumptions of the tests are met (e.g., normality, equal variances). If the assumptions are not met, alternative non-parametric tests or resampling methods can be considered.",

The aim is to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) for these patients without the need for chest X-ray, which is time-consuming and exposes patients to radiation.\n\nThe code starts by loading the dataset, which contains features such as patient sex, age, height, weight, and the OTTD determined by chest X-ray. \n\nDescriptive statistics are then computed to summarize the age and height of patients stratified by sex. The results are stored in a pickle file.\n\nThe dataset does not require any preprocessing, so the code proceeds to the analysis phase.\n\nFirst, the dataset is split into training and testing sets. Four machine learning models (Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network) are instantiated, and hyperparameters are tuned using cross-validation on the training set.\n\nPredictions are made using the tuned models on the testing set. Additionally, formula-based predictions for OTTD are computed based on height, age, and the tube ID.\n\nA statistical test (t-test) is then performed to compare the mean squared error (MSE) between the machine learning predictions and the formula-based predictions.\n\nThree tables are generated:\n(1) Table 1 shows the overall performance of the machine learning models based on the MSE.\n(2) Table 2 shows the overall performance of the formula-based models based on the MSE.\n(3) Table 3 presents the results of the t-test, comparing the performance of the machine learning models with the formula-based models.\n\nFinally, the code saves additional results, including the total number of observations in the dataset and the t-test statistic and p-value, into an additional_results.pkl file.\n\nThe code provides an analysis framework for determining OTTD in pediatric patients using machine learning models and formula-based approaches, comparing their performance and providing insights for clinical decision-making.\n```\n",

    "\\section{Results}\n\nIn this section, we present the results of our analysis, which aimed to predict the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. To achieve this, we utilized a dataset of 969 patients aged 0-7 years who received post-operative mechanical ventilation. We employed machine learning models and formula-based models on patient features such as sex, age, height, and weight to determine the OTTD. \n\nFirst, we conducted a descriptive analysis to assess the age and height distribution stratified by sex (Table~\\ref{table:desc_stats_age_height}). The mean age was 0.732 years for females and 0.781 years for males. The mean height was found to be 65.4 cm for females and 66.5 cm for males. These results provide insight into the patient characteristics in our dataset, which will aid in interpreting the performance of the predictive models.\n\nNext, we evaluated the performance of four machine learning models, namely Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network, in predicting the OTTD. The models were trained using the features of sex, age, height, and weight, and their performance was assessed using mean squared error (MSE). The Random Forest model achieved an MSE of 1.44, the Elastic Net model achieved an MSE of 1.04, the SVM model achieved an MSE of 1.02, and the Neural Network model achieved an MSE of 1.21 (Table~\\ref{table:ml_model_perf}). These results demonstrate the potential of machine learning models in accurately predicting the OTTD.\n\nAdditionally, we compared the performance of formula-based models in predicting the OTTD. We employed the Height Formula, Age Formula, and Tube ID Formula in our analysis. The Height Formula had an MSE of 3.19, the Age Formula had an MSE of 6.38, and the Tube ID Formula had an MSE of 1.84 (Table~\\ref{table:formula_model_perf}). These findings indicate that the machine learning models outperformed the formula-based models in predicting the OTTD.\n\nTo further assess the performance of the machine learning models compared to the formula-based models, we conducted an independent t-test. The t-test resulted in a t-statistic of -2.317 and a p-value of 0.06834, suggesting a trend towards statistically significant differences between the two groups (Table~\\ref{table:ttest_ml_formula}). However, the p-value did not reach the conventional threshold for statistical significance. \n\nIn summary, our analysis demonstrates that machine learning models, utilizing patient features such as sex, age, height, and weight, can accurately predict the OTTD in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. The machine learning models outperformed the formula-based models in terms of predictive accuracy. However, further validation studies are needed before these models can be implemented in clinical practice.",

Our analysis employed machine learning models and formula-based models to predict the OTTD based on patient characteristics such as sex, age, height, and weight. The results are presented in Table~\\ref{table:desc_stats_age_height}.\n\nFirst, to understand the distribution of age and height stratified by sex, we calculated the descriptive statistics. As shown in Table~\\ref{table:desc_stats_age_height}, the average age for female and male patients was 0.732 years (SD=1.4) and 0.781 years (SD=1.47), respectively. The average height for female and male patients was 65.4 cm (SD=18.7) and 66.5 cm (SD=19.4), respectively. These findings highlight the age and height characteristics of the pediatric population in our dataset.\n\nNext, we evaluated the performance of machine learning models in predicting the OTTD. The results, shown in Table~\\ref{table:ml_model_perf}, indicate that the Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network models achieved mean squared errors of 1.44, 1.04, 1.02, and 1.21, respectively. \n\nTo compare the performance of machine learning models with formula-based models, we calculated the mean squared errors of the Height Formula, Age Formula, and Tube ID Formula. As shown in Table~\\ref{table:formula_model_perf}, the mean squared errors for the Height Formula, Age Formula, and Tube ID Formula were 3.19, 6.38, and 1.84, respectively.

    "```latex\n\\section{Results}\n\nDetermining the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation is critical for ensuring safe and effective ventilation. In our analysis, we focused on the important characteristics of age and height, which can significantly impact tracheal tube placement. Pediatric patients have shorter tracheal lengths compared to adults, making it crucial to accurately determine the optimal tube depth to avoid serious complications or even mortality. With this motivation, we performed a comprehensive analysis using a dataset of 969 patients aged 0-7 years who received post-operative mechanical ventilation.\n\nTo understand the distribution of age and height stratified by sex in our dataset, we calculated descriptive statistics, as shown in Table~\\ref{table:desc_stats_age_height}. The average age for female and male patients was 0.732 years (SD=1.4) and 0.781 years (SD=1.47), respectively. The average height for female and male patients was 65.4 cm (SD=18.7) and 66.5 cm (SD=19.4), respectively. These findings provide important insights into the age and height characteristics of the pediatric population and highlight the need for accurate determination of the optimal tracheal tube depth.\n\nNext, we evaluated the performance of machine learning models in predicting the OTTD using patient characteristics such as sex, age, height, and weight. Four models, namely Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network, were trained and tested. The performance of these models is presented in Table~\\ref{table:ml_model_perf}. Based on the mean squared error, the Elastic Net model achieved the best performance with an MSE of 1.04, followed closely by the Support Vector Machine model with an MSE of 1.02. The Random Forest model achieved an MSE of 1.44, while the Neural Network model achieved an MSE of 1.21.\n\nTo compare the performance of machine learning models with formula-based models, we calculated the mean squared errors of three formula-based models: Height Formula, Age Formula, and Tube ID Formula. The results, shown in Table~\\ref{table:formula_model_perf}, indicate that machine learning models outperformed formula-based models in predicting the OTTD. The Height Formula had the highest MSE of 3.19, followed by the Tube ID Formula with an MSE of 1.84. The Age Formula had the highest MSE among all models with an MSE of 6.38.\n\nWe performed an independent t-test to compare the performance of machine learning models and formula-based models, as presented in Table~\\ref{table:ttest_ml_formula}. The t-test revealed a t-statistic of -2.317 and a p-value of 0.06834. Although the p-value did not reach statistical significance at the conventional threshold of 0.05, the t-test suggests a potential difference in performance between the two model types.\n\nIn summary, our analysis demonstrates the potential of machine learning models in accurately predicting the optimal tracheal tube depth in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. The Elastic Net and Support Vector Machine models achieved the best performance among the machine learning models. Furthermore, machine learning models outperformed formula-based models in terms of mean squared error. It is important to consider these findings in the context of their potential implications for clinical decision-making and the limitations of our study. Further research is needed to validate the effectiveness of machine learning models in clinical settings and to address any concerns regarding their interpretability and generalizability.",
    "```latex\n\\section{Results}\n\nWe conducted a comprehensive analysis to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Our dataset included 969 patients aged 0-7 years who received post-operative mechanical ventilation. Our analytical approach incorporated machine learning models and formula-based models to predict OTTD based on patient characteristics such as sex, age, height, and weight. \n\nInitially, we profiled our data sample by calculating descriptive statistics of age and height, stratified by sex (Table\\textasciitilde{}\\ref{table:desc_stats_age_height}). This statistical profiling is an important step as age and height are considered as essential characteristics when determining OTTD in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. The results showed an average age of 0.732 years (SD=1.4) for female and 0.781 years (SD=1.47) for male patients. Similarly, the average height for female and male patients was 65.4 cm (SD=18.7) and 66.5 cm (SD=19.4) respectively.\n\nWe then evaluated the performance of the machine learning models in predicting the OTTD (Table\\textasciitilde{}\\ref{table:ml_model_perf}). The Support Vector Machine model achieved the lowest mean squared error (1.02), implying that this model predicted the OTTD with the highest accuracy among the models tested.\n\nWe compared these results with those of formula-based models in predicting the OTTD. As indicated in Table\\textasciitilde{}\\ref{table:formula_model_perf}, the mean squared error for the Height Formula was 3.19, which was greater than those of the machine learning models. Similarly, the Age Formula and Tube ID Formula models resulted in mean squared errors of 6.38 and 1.84 respectively, implying that the machine learning models outperformed these formula-based models in predicting the OTTD.\n\nFinally, we compared the performance differences between the machine learning models and the formula-based models using an independent t-test. The t-statistic was -2.317, and the p-value was 0.06834, suggesting a potential difference in performance between the two types of models but not at a statistically significant level (Table\\textasciitilde{}\\ref{table:ttest_ml_formula}).\n\nIn summary, our analysis accentuates the potential of machine learning models, specifically the Support Vector Machine model, in accurately predicting the OTTD in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Although further validation is needed before clinical implementation, our findings represent pivotal progress in improving the safety and efficiency of ventilation processes in pediatric patients.\n```",
