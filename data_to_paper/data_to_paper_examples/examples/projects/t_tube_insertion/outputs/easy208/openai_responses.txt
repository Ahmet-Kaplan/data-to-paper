The mean and standard deviation of these features are stored in a pandas DataFrame and saved as \"table_0.pkl\".\n\nThe code then splits the dataset into a training set and a testing set for model building. Two regression models, namely Random Forest (RF) and Elastic Net (EN), are trained using the training set. The RF model is built using the RandomForestRegressor class from scikit-learn, while the EN model is built using the ElasticNetCV class with cross-validation. The models are then used to predict the OTTD for the testing set.\n\nThe performance of each model is evaluated by calculating the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted OTTD and the actual OTTD in the testing set. The RF model's MSE is saved in a pandas DataFrame and stored as \"table_2.pkl\", while the EN model's MSE is stored as \"table_3.pkl\".\n\nTo compare the performance of the RF and EN models statistically, a hypothesis test is conducted using a paired t-test.

The t-statistic and p-value of the hypothesis test are calculated and saved in the \"additional_results.pkl\" file.\n\nIn summary, the code performs data analysis tasks including data preparation, model building, model evaluation, and hypothesis testing.

The mean age of the patients was 0.758 years (SD=1.44), with a mean height of 66 cm (SD=19.1) and a mean weight of 7.13 kg (SD=4.77). The mean OTTD determined by chest X-ray was 10.2 cm (SD=1.77). These descriptive statistics provide an overview of the patient demographics and the variability in the OTTD values.\n\nNext, we developed and compared two machine learning models to predict the OTTD using the patient features. The random forest regression model achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 1.95 (Table \\ref{table:rf_model_performance}). The elastic net regression model, on the other hand, achieved a lower MSE of 1.33 (Table \\ref{table:en_model_performance}). The performance of both models indicates their potential for accurately predicting the OTTD in pediatric patients.\n\nTo further verify the performance of the models, we conducted a hypothesis test comparing the squared prediction errors of the random forest and elastic net models. The t-test yielded a t-statistic of 3.752, indicating a statistically significant difference between the two models (p < 0.000212). This suggests that the elastic net model outperforms the random forest model in predicting the OTTD.\n\nIn summary, our analysis demonstrates that machine learning models, specifically the elastic net model, can be effective in accurately predicting the optimal tracheal tube depth in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.
