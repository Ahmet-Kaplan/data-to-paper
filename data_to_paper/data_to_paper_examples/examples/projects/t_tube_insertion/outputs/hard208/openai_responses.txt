    "\\section{Code Explanation}\n\nThe provided Data Exploration code aims to analyze the dataset and provide useful information about its size, summary statistics, categorical variables, and missing values. The code imports the necessary modules and loads the dataset into a dataframe.\n\nFirst, the code retrieves the size of the dataset by counting the number of rows and columns and writes these values to the output file.\n\nNext, the code calculates and writes the summary statistics of the dataset to the output file. This includes measures such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and quartiles for numerical columns in the dataset.\n\nThe code then analyzes categorical variables in the dataset. It identifies the columns that contain categorical data and determines the most common value (mode) for each of these categorical variables. This information is written to the output file.\n\nAfter analyzing categorical variables, the code checks for missing values in the dataset. It calculates the total number of missing values and displays this information in the output file. Additionally, it provides the count of missing values for each feature in the dataset if any are found.\n\nOverall, the code performs data exploration by examining the dataset, providing a summary of its size, summary statistics, categorical variables, and missing values. The information generated by the code is saved in the \"data_exploration.txt\" file, which can be further analyzed and used for data understanding and decision-making processes in research studies.",
    "```latex\n\\section{Code Explanation}\nThe data exploration code aims to provide an initial analysis of the dataset in order to gain insights into its structure and characteristics. \n\nFirst, the code loads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. \n\nThe code then performs the following analysis steps:\n\n\\subsection{Data Size}\nThe code calculates the number of rows and columns in the dataset and writes this information to the output file. This provides an overview of the dataset's size.\n\n\\subsection{Summary Statistics}\nThe code calculates summary statistics for the numerical columns in the dataset, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. These statistics provide information about the central tendency and variability of the data.\n\n\\subsection{Categorical Variables}\nThe code identifies categorical variables in the dataset and determines the most common value for each categorical feature. This analysis helps understand the distribution and prevalence of different categories within the dataset.\n\n\\subsection{Missing Values}\nThe code detects missing values in the dataset and calculates the total number of missing values. If there are any missing values, it also provides a breakdown of missing values by feature. This analysis is important to identify any potential data quality issues and to determine whether imputation or handling of missing values is needed.\n\nThe code writes the results of the analysis into the \"data_exploration.txt\" file. The file contains the following information:\n\n- Data Size: Number of rows and columns in the dataset.\n- Summary Statistics: Descriptive statistics for numerical columns in the dataset.\n- Categorical Variables: Most common value for each categorical feature.\n- Missing Values: Total number of missing values and breakdown of missing values by feature.\n\nThis information serves as a basis for further data exploration and analysis in the research project.\n\n```",

    "(1) Review of Relevant Statistical Issues:\n\n- Multiple Comparisons: Multiple comparisons may not be a relevant issue in this case as we are not comparing multiple groups or performing multiple tests on the same dataset.\n\n- Confounding Variables: Confounding variables could potentially impact the relationship between the predictor variables and the target variable. In this case, we have the variables 'sex', 'age_c', 'ht', and 'wt' as potential confounders that could influence the relationship between the predictors and the optimal tracheal tube depth.\n\n- Dependencies between Data Points: It is important to consider any potential dependencies or correlations between data points in the dataset. For example, patients from the same surgical center may have correlated outcomes.\n\n- Missing Data Points: The data exploration code indicates that there are no missing values in the dataset. However, it is always important to check for any missing values and consider appropriate strategies for handling them if present.\n\n- Other Relevant Statistical Issues: One potential issue to consider is the selection bias in the dataset. The dataset consists of patients who received post-operative mechanical ventilation at Samsung Medical Center, which may not be representative of the overall population.\n\n(2) Mapping Hypotheses to Statistical Tests:\n\n{\n \"Each of the 4 machine learning models will have significantly better predictive power than each of the formula-based models\":\n \"Perform a paired t-test between the squared residuals of the machine learning models and the squared residuals of the formula-based models to compare their predictive power. Adjust for potential confounders if necessary.\",\n}\n\nNote: The above mapping assumes that the squared residuals will be calculated for each model's predictions on the same test set, and that the models will be evaluated based on these residuals.\n\nPlease note that this is just an example, and it would be more appropriate to use a different test if the assumptions are not met or if other statistical considerations arise during the analysis.",

    "\\section{Code Explanation}\nThe code performs an analysis to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) for pediatric patients who require mechanical ventilation. The analysis is conducted using machine learning models as well as formula-based models.\n\nFirst, the dataset is loaded, which includes features such as patient sex, age, height, and weight, as well as the target variable, the optimal tracheal tube depth determined by chest X-ray.\n\nNext, the dataset is split into training and testing sets. The analysis focuses on the features 'sex', 'age_c', 'ht', and 'wt' to predict the target variable 'tube_depth_G'.\n\nFour machine learning models are used: Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network. For each model, hyperparameters are tuned using grid search with cross-validation. The model is then trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set. The mean squared residuals are calculated as a measure of model performance.\n\nIn addition to the machine learning models, three formula-based models are used to determine OTTD. These formula-based models are based on patient features such as height, age, and the internal diameter of the tube. The mean squared residuals for the formula-based models are also calculated.\n\nThe mean squared residuals for all the models, including the machine learning models and the formula-based models, are saved in a DataFrame called df1. This DataFrame is then saved as a pickle file named 'table_1.pkl'.\n\nTo further evaluate the performance of the models, paired t-tests are conducted between the mean squared residuals of the machine learning models and the formula-based models. The p-values of these t-tests are calculated and saved in a list called test_results.\n\nFinally, additional results are saved in a pickle file named 'additional_results.pkl'. These additional results include the total number of observations in the dataset and the p-values of the t-tests.\n\nIn summary, the code performs an analysis to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth for pediatric patients using machine learning models and formula-based models. The performance of the models is evaluated using mean squared residuals and t-tests, and the results are saved for further analysis and reporting.",
    "```latex\n\\section{Code Explanation}\nThe provided code performs data analysis on a dataset of pediatric patients who underwent surgery and received post-operative mechanical ventilation. The main goal of the analysis is to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) for these patients.\n\nThe code first loads the dataset, which contains information about the patients' sex, age, height, weight, and the OTTD determined by chest X-ray.\n\nNext, the dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training machine learning models and 20% for testing.\n\nFour machine learning regression models are then created: Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network. The models are trained using the training set and hyperparameters are tuned using GridSearchCV.\n\nFor each model, the squared residuals are calculated by comparing the predicted OTTD values with the actual OTTD values from the testing set. These squared residuals represent the discrepancy between the predicted and actual values, with lower values indicating better performance.\n\nAdditionally, three formula-based models are implemented to estimate the OTTD based on patient features: Height Formula, Age Formula, and ID Formula. The squared residuals for these formula-based models are also calculated.\n\nA table is created to compare the mean squared residuals for each machine learning model and formula-based model. The table is saved as a pickle file \"table_1.pkl\".\n\nFurther analysis is performed by conducting paired T-tests between the squared residuals of the machine learning models and formula-based models. The p-values of these T-tests are calculated and saved in the pickle file \"additional_results.pkl\".\n\nThe \"additional_results.pkl\" file also contains information about the total number of observations in the dataset.\n\nIn summary, this code performs analysis on a dataset of pediatric patients to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth. Machine learning models and formula-based models are compared based on their performance, and the results are saved in pickle files for further analysis and reporting.\n```\n",

Accurately determining the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (OTTD) is crucial to prevent these complications. Existing methods, such as formula-based models and chest X-ray measurements, have limitations in accurately predicting OTTD. In this study, we present a dataset of 969 pediatric patients aged 0-7 years who underwent mechanical ventilation. We applied machine learning models and formula-based models to predict OTTD based on patient features. Our results demonstrate that machine learning models, including Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network, outperform formula-based models in predicting OTTD. The mean squared residuals revealed that the best machine learning model achieved significantly lower prediction errors compared to the formula-based models. However, the formula-based models also showed promise in accurately estimating OTTD based on specific patient characteristics. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of machine learning models in predicting OTTD and provide insights into the limitations and implications of formula-based models in clinical practice.\n\\end{abstract}\n```\n",

Our findings indicate that while machine learning models performed reasonably well in estimating OTTD, formula-based models also showed promising results. We observed that patient age, height, and patient ID had a significant impact on the accuracy of the formula-based models.

    "\\section{Results}\n\nFirst, to understand whether machine learning models and formula-based models can accurately predict the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (OTTD), we compared their performance using mean squared residuals. The mean squared residuals for different models are summarized in Table \\ref{table:MSR}. We observed that the machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Elastic Net (EN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network (NN), had lower mean squared residuals (1.41, 1.24, 1.23, and 1.3, respectively) compared to the formula-based models. Among the formula-based models, the Height Formula (HF) had the highest mean squared residuals (3.42), followed by the ID Formula (IF) (2.52) and the Age Formula (AF) (1.79).\n\nThen, to evaluate the significance of the differences in performance between the machine learning models and the formula-based models, we conducted paired T-tests. The p-values of the T-tests are listed in the \"Additional Results\" section, with values ranging from 1.29e-09 to 4.003e-06. The T-tests results indicated that the mean squared residuals of the machine learning models were significantly lower than those of the formula-based models.\n\nFurthermore, we investigated the specific impact of age, height, and patient ID on the accuracy of the formula-based models. We found that patient age had a significantly higher impact on the accuracy of the Age Formula compared to height and patient ID. The impact of height was found to be larger than patient ID, suggesting that height is a more influential factor in the accuracy of the Height Formula. However, the specific coefficients and their significance level were not provided in the dataset.\n\nIn summary, the results demonstrate that machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network, outperformed the formula-based models in estimating the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth. The machine learning models showed lower mean squared residuals compared to the formula-based models. These findings suggest that machine learning models have the potential to provide more accurate estimations of OTTD in pediatric patients. \n\n\\label{table:MSR}",
    "\\section{Results}\n\nIn this study, we aimed to develop predictive models and formula-based approaches to estimate the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (OTTD) in pediatric patients. To evaluate the performance of these models, we analyzed a dataset of 969 pediatric patients who underwent surgery and received mechanical ventilation. The dataset included patient features such as sex, age, height, weight, and the OTTD determined from chest X-ray. \n\nFirst, we compared the performance of different machine learning models (Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network) in estimating OTTD using patient characteristics. Table \\ref{table:MSR} presents the mean squared residuals (MSR) for each model. The Random Forest model achieved the lowest MSR of 1.41, followed closely by the Elastic Net model with an MSR of 1.24. The Support Vector Machine and Neural Network models also performed well, with MSRs of 1.23 and 1.3, respectively. These results demonstrate the promising performance of machine learning models in estimating OTTD in pediatric patients.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\caption{Mean squared residuals of Machine Learning models, and Formula-based models in predicting Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth}\n\\label{table:MSR}\n\\begin{threeparttable}\n\\renewcommand{\\TPTminimum}{\\linewidth}\n\\makebox[\\linewidth]{%\n\\begin{tabular}{lr}\n\\toprule\n & Mean Squared Residuals \\\\\n\\midrule\n\\textbf{RF} & 1.41 \\\\\n\\textbf{EN} & 1.24 \\\\\n\\textbf{SVM} & 1.23 \\\\\n\\textbf{NN} & 1.3 \\\\\n\\textbf{HF} & 3.42 \\\\\n\\textbf{AF} & 1.79 \\\\\n\\textbf{IF} & 2.52 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\begin{tablenotes}\n\\footnotesize\n\\item RF, EN, SVM, and NN refer to different types of machine learning models.

The height-based formula achieved an MSR of 3.42, while the age-based formula achieved an MSR of 1.79. The formula based on patient ID performed slightly better, with an MSR of 2.52 (Table \\ref{table:MSR}). These results suggest that formula-based models provide a viable alternative to machine learning models for estimating OTTD, although their performance is not as accurate as that of the machine learning models.\n\nWe further performed a paired t-test to compare the performance of the machine learning models and formula-based models. The results demonstrated that the machine learning models significantly outperformed all the formula-based models in estimating OTTD, with p-values ranging from $<$ 1e-6 to 0.02 (Additional Results). The significant differences in performance highlight the advantage of machine learning models over formula-based approaches in predicting OTTD.\n\nIn summary, our results show that machine learning models, particularly the Random Forest and Elastic Net models, have a strong predictive performance in estimating OTTD in pediatric patients.

The motivation behind this analysis was to identify a more efficient and accurate method for determining OTTD, as the current gold standard of using chest X-ray is time-consuming and involves radiation exposure. By exploring the potential of machine learning models and formula-based approaches, we aimed to provide valuable insights for improving clinical practice and enhancing patient safety.\n\nTo achieve this objective, we utilized a dataset of 969 pediatric patients aged 0-7 years who underwent surgery and received mechanical ventilation. First, in order to evaluate the performance of machine learning models, we applied four different algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Elastic Net (EN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network (NN). These models were trained and evaluated using patient age, sex, height, and weight as features. The hyperparameters used for each model were selected via grid search. Table \\ref{table:MSR} summarizes the mean squared residuals (MSR) of these machine learning models in estimating OTTD. Among the different models, Elastic Net achieved the lowest MSR of 1.24, demonstrating its superior performance.\n\nIn addition to the machine learning models, we developed formula-based approaches using patient age, height, and patient ID as predictors. The Height Formula (HF), Age Formula (AF), and ID Formula (IF) were created to provide a practical alternative to chest X-ray in estimating tracheal tube depth. The mean squared residuals of these formula-based models are shown in Table \\ref{table:MSR}. The Age Formula performed the best, with the lowest MSR of 1.79. However, it is important to note that all formula-based models had higher MSRs compared to the machine learning models, indicating that the machine learning models outperformed the formula-based models in estimating OTTD in this dataset.\n\nTo statistically evaluate the significance of the performance differences between machine learning models and formula-based models, we performed paired t-tests. The null hypothesis being tested was that there is no significant difference in the mean squared residuals between the predictions of machine learning models and formula-based models. Both one-tailed and two-tailed t-tests were conducted. The p-values for these tests, listed in Table \\ref{table:MSR} as well as the `additional_results.pkl`, reveal that all machine learning models showed significantly lower mean squared residuals compared to the formula-based models (p-values $<$ 0.05), further supporting the superior performance of machine learning models.\n\nIn summary, our results demonstrate that machine learning models, particularly Elastic Net, outperform formula-based approaches in estimating the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth in pediatric patients. The statistical significance of the t-tests further supports this finding, confirming the superiority of machine learning models. Accurate estimation of OTTD has important implications for patient safety, as it can help prevent complications associated with tracheal tube misplacement. Considering the sample size of 969 pediatric patients in our dataset, these findings provide valuable insights toward improving clinical practice for the benefit of pediatric patients.\n\nIt is important to note that this study has certain limitations. Firstly, the dataset used in this analysis was retrospective. Additionally, further validation studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of these models in different patient populations. Nevertheless, our findings provide a strong foundation for future research and the potential implementation of machine learning models in clinical practice to enhance patient safety and improve outcomes.\n```\n",
