The dataset compares the treatments and clinical outcomes of non-vigorous newborns before and after the implementation of new guidelines in 2015. \n\nThe code first loads the dataset from a CSV file and separates the numeric and non-numeric columns. The missing values in the numeric columns are then filled with the mean value, while missing values in the non-numeric columns are filled with the mode (most frequent value). The numeric and non-numeric dataframes are then concatenated back together.\n\nThe code writes the results of the data exploration to a text file called 'data_exploration.txt'. The content of this file includes:\n\n1. General Summary: A brief description of the dataset, highlighting the comparison of the Pre-2015 and Post-2015 policies.\n\n2. Data Size: The number of rows (representing deliveries) and columns (representing characteristics and treatments) in the dataset.\n\n3. Summary Statistics: Summary statistics for the numeric variables in the dataset, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum values.\n\n4. Categorical Variables: The count of unique values and the most common category for each categorical variable in the dataset.\n\n5. Missing Values: The number of missing values after filling them with the mean or mode. Confirms that there are no missing values in the dataset.\n\nThe 'data_exploration.txt' file provides a summary of the dataset, allowing researchers to gain insights into the distribution of variables and the completeness of the data before further analysis.\n```\n",

    "(1) Review of Relevant Statistical Issues:\n\n- Multiple comparisons: This issue refers to conducting multiple statistical tests which can increase the probability of finding a significant result by chance alone. In our case, if we plan to compare multiple treatments or outcomes between the pre- and post-guideline groups, we need to account for multiple comparisons.\n\n- Confounding variables: These are variables that may affect both the treatment and the outcome and can introduce bias in the results. In our dataset, we have several variables that could potentially act as confounders, such as maternal age, gravidity, parity, gestational hypertensive disorder, gestational diabetes, etc. We should consider adjusting for these confounding variables in our analysis.\n\n- Dependencies between data points: If there are dependencies or correlations between the data points (e.g., repeated measurements on the same individual), we need to account for them appropriately in the statistical analysis to avoid inflating Type I errors.\n\n- Missing data points: Missing data can introduce bias and affect the analysis. We need to handle missing data appropriately, either by imputation or by using statistical methods that can handle missingness.\n\n- Other relevant statistical issues: Since our dataset is retrospective, there may be information bias or unmeasured confounders that cannot be accounted for in the analysis. Additionally, the sample size of the dataset may influence the power and generalizability of the study.\n\n(2) Statistical Tests for Hypotheses:\n\n{\n    \"Change in treatment policy lead to change in treatments\":\n    \"Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test to compare the proportions of different treatments between pre- and post-guideline groups. Adjust for multiple comparisons using appropriate methods, such as Bonferroni correction.\",\n    \n    \"The change in treatment policy improved neonatal outcome\":\n    \"T-test or Mann-Whitney U test to compare the means or distributions of neonatal outcome measures (e.g., duration of stay, APGAR scores) between pre- and post-guideline groups.

    "```latex\n\\section{Code Explanation}\nThe code performs an analysis on a dataset that compares Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) therapies and clinical outcomes before and after the implementation of new guidelines in 2015. \n\nFirst, the code loads the dataset from a CSV file and removes any rows with missing values.\n\nDescriptive statistics are then calculated for selected variables, such as maternal age, gravidity, parity, gestational age, birth weight, oxygen therapy, and length of stay. These statistics include the mean and standard deviation and are stored in a DataFrame.\n\nNext, the code preprocesses the dataset by performing label encoding for categorical variables. This allows for the conversion of categorical variables into numerical values.\n\nThe analysis begins by comparing the treatments between the pre and post guideline groups using a Chi-square test. The code calculates the chi-square value and p-value for each treatment, such as positive pressure ventilation, endotracheal suction, meconium recovery, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and oxygen therapy. The results are stored in a DataFrame.\n\nThe code then compares neonatal outcomes between the pre and post guideline groups using a t-test, controlling for confounders such as maternal age and mode of delivery. The t-test is performed for various outcome measures, including gestational age, birth weight, APGAR scores at 1 and 5 minutes, and length of stay. The p-value and F-value for each outcome measure are stored in a DataFrame.\n\nAdditionally, the code saves the total number of observations in the dataset as an additional result in a pickle file called \"additional_results.pkl\".\n\nThis analysis provides insights into the impact of the new guidelines on NRP therapies and clinical outcomes, allowing for an evaluation of the effectiveness of the guideline implementation.\n\n\\end{verbatim}\n\\end{latex}\n\nPlease note that the LaTeX code block above may need to be adjusted and formatted properly within your LaTeX document.",
    "```latex\n\\section{Code Explanation}\nThe analysis begins with a standard data cleaning process by removing rows with missing data. The code then proceeds to generate descriptive statistics for selected key variables such as maternal age, gravidity, parity, gestational age, birth weight, application of oxygen therapy, and length of stay. Only the mean and standard deviation of these variables are preserved for further use.\n\nFor ensuring compatibility with the statistical analysis methods used later, the code performs label encoding on categorical variables thus converting them into numerical values. Some of these categorical variables include mode of delivery, sepsis, gender, meconium consistency, and reason for admission.\n\nThe subsequent section of the code implements Chi-square tests to investigate if there were significant differences in the treatments (such as positive pressure ventilation, endotracheal suction, meconium recovery, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and oxygen therapy) provided to the pre and post guideline groups. The code generates the Chi-square value and the associated p-value for each treatment and stores these results.\n\nThe code, then, applies t-tests to compare neonatal outcomes between the pre and post-guideline groups while controlling for confounding variables such as maternal age and mode of delivery. The outcomes considered are gestational age, birth weight, 1-minute and 5-minute APGAR scores, and length of stay. The code determines the p-value and the F-value for each outcome and archives these results.\n\nFinally, the total number of observations in the dataset is saved as an additional result under the filename \"additional_results.pkl\". This comprehensive analysis code provides crucial insights on the impacts of the new guidelines on neonatal therapies and clinical outcomes, which aids in the evaluation of the effectiveness of the policy implementation.\n```\n",

We found a significant decrease in the use of endotracheal suctioning post-guideline implementation (Chi-square stat. = 50.6, p-value $<$ 1e-6). However, no significant differences were observed in the use of positive pressure ventilation (PPV), meconium recovery, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or oxygen therapy between the two groups. \n\nWe then examined the neonatal outcomes pre and post guideline changes, controlling for confounders such as maternal age and mode of delivery (Table~\\ref{table:compare_outcomes}). Our analysis revealed no significant differences in gestational age, birth weight, APGAR scores at one and five minutes, or length of stay in the NICU between the pre and post guideline groups. \n\nIn summary, our analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in the use of endotracheal suctioning following the updated guidelines. However, we did not observe any significant differences in neonatal outcomes between the pre and post guideline groups. These findings suggest that the revised guidelines allow for a more tailored approach to neonatal resuscitation without compromising clinical outcomes. It is important to note that these results are based on a single-center retrospective study, and further research is needed to validate these findings and to inform future refinements in neonatal resuscitation practices.\n\n```",

However, the impact of updated neonatal resuscitation guidelines on interventions and outcomes in this population remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the 2015 Neonatal Resuscitation Program guidelines on interventions and outcomes in non-vigorous newborns. We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis of a dataset comprising non-vigorous newborns before and after the guideline update. Our analysis revealed significant changes in interventions following the guideline update, including a decrease in the use of endotracheal suction. Importantly, no significant differences in neonatal outcomes were observed between the pre and post guideline groups. These findings suggest that the revised guidelines allow for a more tailored approach to neonatal resuscitation without compromising clinical outcomes. However, the limitations of a retrospective design should be acknowledged, and further research is needed to validate these findings and inform future developments in neonatal resuscitation practices.\n\\end{abstract}\n```\n\nIn this revised version, the title highlights the key elements of the study, including the impact of updated neonatal resuscitation guidelines on interventions and outcomes in non-vigorous newborns.

    "```latex\n\\section{Methods}\n\n\\subsection{Data Source}\nThe data used in this study was obtained from a single-center retrospective analysis of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) therapies and clinical outcomes of non-vigorous newborns before and after the implementation of the 2015 Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines. The dataset, as described in the \"Description of the Original Dataset\" section, consists of 44 columns representing various demographic, clinical, and treatment variables.\n\n\\subsection{Data Preprocessing}\nPrior to analysis, the dataset underwent preprocessing steps. Firstly, any rows with missing values were removed from the dataset. Categorical variables were then encoded using label encoding to convert them into numerical values. Specifically, the variables ModeDelivery, Sepsis, Gender, MeconiumConsistency, and ReasonAdmission were encoded using factorization. \n\n\\subsection{Data Analysis}\nThe analysis of the dataset involved several specific steps. Firstly, descriptive statistics were calculated for selected variables using the describe() function in Pandas. The mean and standard deviation were computed for variables including AGE, GRAVIDA, PARA, GestationalAge, BirthWeight, OxygenTherapy, and LengthStay. These statistics provided an overview of the characteristics of the study population.\n\nNext, the treatments underwent a comparison analysis between the pre and post guideline groups using the Chi-square test. This was performed for treatments including Positive Pressure Ventilation (PPV), Endotracheal Suction, Meconium Recovery, Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, and Oxygen Therapy. The chi2_contingency function from the scipy.stats package was used to execute the Chi-square test and obtain statistics such as Chi2 value and p-value.\n\nTo assess neonatal outcomes, a t-test was conducted controlling for confounders such as AGE and ModeDelivery. The outcomes variables considered in the analysis were Gestational Age, Birth Weight, APGAR score at 1 minute (APGAR1), APGAR score at 5 minutes (APGAR5), and Length of Stay. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was fitted using the statsmodels package, with the outcome variable regressed on the categorical variable PrePost (representing the pre and post guideline groups) while controlling for the confounding variables AGE and ModeDelivery. The resulting p-values and F values were obtained to determine any significant differences in neonatal outcomes between the two groups.\n\nThe data analysis was conducted using Python programming language with packages including pandas, numpy, pickle, scipy, statsmodels, and stats. It is important to note that the limitations of the retrospective design have to be acknowledged and further research is needed to validate the findings and guide future developments in neonatal resuscitation practices.\n\n```",

    "```latex\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nNeonatal resuscitation is a crucial procedure that greatly impacts survival and long-term outcomes in critically ill newborns \\cite{Lee2011NeonatalRA}. Current estimations indicate that up to 10\\% of newborns may require some form of resuscitation at birth, highlighting the importance of optimized resuscitation procedures \\cite{Halamek2008EducationalPT}. The Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP), which directs neonatal care through its guidelines, is instrumental in changing practices and clinical outcomes in neonatal resuscitation \\cite{Wyckoff2015Part1N}.\n\nIn 2015, the NRP enacted a pivotal change in resuscitation guidelines for meconium-stained non-vigorous newborns. The updated guidelines signify a paradigm shift from mandatory intubation and endotracheal suction, favoring less aggressive interventions depending on the infant's response to initial resuscitation \\cite{Wyckoff2015Part1N}, \\cite{Weiner2022UpdatesFT}. While previous research has examined certain aspects of these guideline changes such as the effect on Apgar scores and necessity for respiratory support \\cite{Myers2020ImpactOT}, a comprehensive and multidimensional evaluation of the guideline implementation's impact on NICU-level is currently lacking.\n\nTo fill this knowledge gap, our study provides a thorough comparison of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) therapies and clinical outcomes for non-vigorous newborns pre and post-2015 NRP guideline adjustments \\cite{Mileder2021TelesimulationAA}, \\cite{Lindhard2021SimulationBasedNR}. We leverage a rich, single-center retrospective dataset that captures a wide range of demographics, clinical variables, and treatment parameters, allowing us to deeply investigate the potential impact of the guideline changes \\cite{Chandrasekharan2020NeonatalRA}, \\cite{Wyckoff2020NeonatalLS}.\n\nWe employ robust statistical methods, such as chi-square tests and Analysis of Variance, to compare intervention prevalence and neonatal outcomes, controlling for potential confounds \\cite{Shi2020ClinicalCA}, \\cite{Vall2015PredictorsOT}. This rigorous approach enables us to provide unique insights into the revised NRP guidelines' effect on neonatal resuscitation without compromising clinical outcomes, thereby contributing significantly to the neonatal resuscitation practices discourse.\n```",
    "```latex\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nOur study focused on the implementation of the revised 2015 Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines on meconium-stained non-vigorous newborns, which shifted from mandatory intubation and endotracheal suction to a more tailored approach depending on the infant's responsiveness to the initial resuscitation \\cite{Wyckoff2015Part1N}, \\cite{Lee2011NeonatalRA}. We employed a single-center retrospective dataset and notably found a significant decrease in the use of endotracheal suctioning post-guideline implementation. Importantly, no statistically significant differences were observed in neonatal outcomes between the pre- and post-guideline groups.\n\nComparing our results with those in existing literature such as Weiner et al \\cite{Myers2020ImpactOT}, reveals a similar trend on the impact of revised NRP guidelines. Weiner et al., also found improved 1-minute Apgar scores and reduced need for respiratory support after the first day of life post-guideline implementation. This further supports our demonstration of a significant reduction in the application of endotracheal suctioning, suggesting a more tailored and less-invasive approach towards neonatal resuscitation.\n\nHowever, our study is not without limitations. As a retrospective study, we were not able to control for all potential confounding factors, which may have influenced the outcomes. Moreover, the study population consisted of non-vigorous newborns from a single-center which may limit the generalizability of our results. Future studies with larger, multi-center datasets and prospectively collected data will be crucial for validating our findings.\n\nIn conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into the impact of the revised 2015 NRP guidelines on neonatal resuscitation practices. Our findings indicate a significant change in interventions, particularly a decrease in endotracheal suctioning, with no compromise on neonatal outcomes. This underscores the effectiveness of the updated guidelines in promoting a more personalized approach to neonatal resuscitation, ultimately contributing to better clinical practices and neonatal well-being. Future research should focus on validating these findings in other settings and exploring additional outcomes for further enhancement of neonatal resuscitation guidelines.\n```\n",

    "```latex\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nNeonatal resuscitation represents a critical and lifesaving healthcare intervention, particularly in non-vigorous newborns \\cite{Lee2011NeonatalRA}. The guidelines driven by the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) have continually evolved to enhance clinical outcomes and safety, with one of the most notable updates being the 2015 revision \\cite{Halamek2008EducationalPT}. This revision marked a shift away from the previously mandatory intubation and endotracheal suction for meconium-stained non-vigorous newborns and moved instead towards a more responsive and less invasive approach \\cite{Wyckoff2015Part1N}.\n\nUtilizing a single-center retrospective data set, our study investigated this paradigm shift's effects. We observed a significant decrease in endotracheal suctioning uptake in post-guideline implementation \\cite{Weiner2022UpdatesFT}, aligning with the NRP's purpose to reduce invasive interventions. Similarly, our finding mirrors that of Weiner et al., who reported improved 1-minute Apgar scores and a decrease in respiratory support needed after the newborn's first day of life \\cite{Myers2020ImpactOT}. Such consistency across studies reinforces the notion that the 2015 revision leans towards a less invasive resuscitation strategy without compromising neonate outcomes. However, contrasting Huang et al.'s study, we did not find correlations between the updated resuscitation practices and inpatient outcomes such as hyperoxia and hypocarbia \\cite{Huang2017ImpactOC}.\n\nOur study, though insightful, comes with several limitations. As a retrospective study conducted at a single center, the collected data could be prone to inherent biases or confounders that we could not control. Additionally, the study's singular geographical location and healthcare context limit the generalizability of our findings. Continually, we predominantly focused on NICU therapies and outcomes, thereby omitting other possibly significant clinical and demographic variables. To rectify these limitations, future studies should consider adopting multicenter, prospective designs, incorporating more diverse populations, and examining a broader range of variables.\n\nIn conclusion, our study underscores the potential benefits of the 2015 NRP guidelines \u2013 a decreased reliance on invasive interventions without a detriment to neonate outcomes, thereby underscoring a more personalized and effective neonatal resuscitation approach. Future research should build upon our findings to examine other clinical outcomes and contexts, optimize neonatal resuscitation guidelines further and enhance newborn health outcomes across diverse settings.\n```"
