Here is our Hypothesis Testing Plan:

Hypothesis: Change in treatment policy led to a change in treatments
Statistical Test: Chi-square test of independence between PrePost (treatment policy) and relevant treatment variables such as PPV, EndotrachealSuction, CardiopulmonaryResuscitation

Hypothesis: The change in treatment policy improved neonatal outcome, measured by duration of stay
Statistical Test: Two-sample t-test comparing the mean length of stay for the Pre (before policy change) group and Post (after policy change) group

Hypothesis: The change in treatment policy improved neonatal outcome, measured by Apgar scores
Statistical Test: Two-sample t-test comparing the mean APGAR1 and APGAR5 scores for the Pre group and Post group
