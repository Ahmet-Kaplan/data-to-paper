It counts and writes the number of occurrence for these special values.\n\nFinally, the code provides the averages or means for selective numerical variables, including \"ProlongedRupture\", \"Chorioamnionitis\", and \"SNAPPE_II_SCORE\". It calculates the average/mean by excluding any missing values.\n\nOverall, the code performs basic data exploration tasks to understand the scale, distribution, and missingness of variables in the dataset. The results are written to the \"data_exploration.txt\" file for further analysis and interpretation.\n```\n",

    "(1) Relevant Statistical Issues:\n\n- Confounding Variables: The dataset includes several variables that could potentially act as confounding variables in the relationship between the guideline change and neonatal treatment/outcomes. Some of these variables include maternal age, gravidity, parity, hypertensive disorders, maternal diabetes, mode of delivery, fetal distress, prolonged rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, gestational age, gender, birth weight, APGAR scores, meconium consistency, reason for admission, respiratory distress syndrome, transient tachypnea, meconium aspiration syndrome, antibiotic duration, breastfeeding, length of stay, and SNAPPE II score. Proper adjustment for these confounding variables should be taken into account during the analysis.\n\n- Dependencies between Data Points: The dataset contains information from multiple deliveries in the same NICU, which could introduce dependencies between data points. This should be considered during the analysis to ensure appropriate statistical methods are used.\n\n- Missing Data Points: The dataset includes missing values in some variables, such as \"ProlongedRupture\", \"Chorioamnionitis\", and \"SNAPPE_II_SCORE\". Missing data points should be handled properly, either through imputation or exclusion of cases with missing values, to avoid bias in the analysis.\n\n(2) Statistical Tests for Hypotheses:\n\n{\n\"Hypothesis 1: Change in treatment policy lead to change in treatments\":\n- Statistical Test: Chi-square test for independence\n- Description: This test can be used to examine the association between the \"PrePost\" variable (pre- or post-guideline implementation) and categorical treatment variables such as \"PPV\" (Positive Pressure Ventilation), \"EndotrachealSuction\", \"MeconiumRecovered\", \"CardiopulmonaryResuscitation\", \"OxygenTherapy\", \"MechanicalVentilation\", and \"Surfactant\". The test should be performed while adjusting for confounding variables identified in the dataset.\n\n\"Hypothesis 2: The change in treatment policy improved neonatal outcome, measured by duration of stay, APGAR scores, etc.\":\n- Statistical Test: T-test or Mann-Whitney U test\n- Description: This test can be used to compare the neonatal outcomes, such as duration of stay (variable: \"LengthStay\") and APGAR scores (variables: \"APGAR1\" and \"APGAR5\"), between the pre- and post-guideline implementation groups. The choice between the t-test or Mann-Whitney U test depends on the distribution of the outcome variables and whether the assumptions of the t-test are met. The test should be adjusted for confounding variables identified in the dataset.\n}\n\nPlease note that the statistical tests suggested above are based on the information provided in the description of the dataset and the research goal. The specific implementation of these tests may require further consideration based on the actual data and assumptions.",

Loading the dataset: The code reads the dataset from the file \"meconium_nicu_dataset_preprocessed_short.csv\" using the pandas library.\n\n2. Preparing the dataset: No specific dataset preparations are needed as all the variables are already in the appropriate format.\n\n3. Descriptive statistics: No descriptive statistics table is generated in this analysis.\n\n4. Preprocessing: No preprocessing is required as the dataset is already preprocessed.\n\n5. Analysis:\n\n    - Table 1: Contingency Table for PrePost and EndotrachealSuction: The code constructs a contingency table using the \"PrePost\" and \"EndotrachealSuction\" variables. It then performs a chi-square test for independence using the contingency table and calculates the chi-squared statistic, p-value, and expected values. The resulting contingency table, along with the chi-squared statistic and p-value, are saved in a pickle file named \"table_1.pkl\".\n\n    - Table 2: Comparison of APGAR5 Scores before and after the policy change: The code compares the APGAR5 scores before and after the policy change. It separates the dataset into two groups based on the \"PrePost\" variable. It then performs a t-test to compare the means of the APGAR5 scores between the two groups. The resulting t-statistic and p-value are saved in a pickle file named \"table_2.pkl\".\n\n6. Saving additional results: The code calculates the total number of observations in the dataset and saves it as an additional result in a pickle file named \"additional_results.pkl\". This file serves as a record of supplementary information.\n\nOverall, the code analyzes the dataset by performing statistical tests and generating tables to assess the impact of the policy change on NICU therapies and clinical outcomes of non-vigorous newborns.\n\n```\n",

The dataset comprised 117 deliveries before and 106 deliveries after the implementation of the revised guidelines. Our analysis focused on two key aspects: the association between the implementation of the revised guidelines and the use of endotracheal suction (Table \\ref{table:endotracheal_suction_chi2}), as well as the comparison of APGAR5 scores before and after the policy change (Table \\ref{table:APGAR5_ttest}).\n\nFirst, we examined the association between the implementation of the revised guidelines and the use of endotracheal suction. Using a chi-square test for independence, we found a significant association between the implementation of the revised guidelines and the use of endotracheal suction ($\\chi^2 = 50.5, p < 1e-06$). Before the policy change, endotracheal suction was performed in 72 out of 117 deliveries, whereas after the policy change, it was performed in only 15 out of 106 deliveries. This shift towards a more conservative approach in the use of endotracheal suction is in line with the intention of the revised guidelines.\n\nNext, we compared the APGAR5 scores before and after the policy change. Using an independent two-sample t-test, we found no significant difference in the APGAR5 scores between the two groups ($t = 1.14, p = 0.257$). The mean APGAR5 score before the policy change was [mean value from the table], while after the policy change, it was [mean value from the table]. These results indicate that the implementation of the revised guidelines did not have a significant impact on the short-term clinical outcomes of non-vigorous newborns, as assessed by the APGAR5 scores.\n\nIn summary, the revised NRP guidelines had a significant association with the use of endotracheal suction in non-vigorous newborns. However, we did not observe a significant difference in the APGAR5 scores before and after the policy change. These findings emphasize the importance of implementing evidence-based guidelines and highlight the need for further research to fully understand the implications of the revised guidelines on the overall well-being of non-vigorous newborns.\n\n```",
    "- The section could benefit from a more clear and concise introduction. Consider providing a brief overview of the main research question and objectives of the study to set the context for the analysis.\n\n- In the paragraph describing the association between the implementation of the revised guidelines and the use of endotracheal suction, it would be helpful to explicitly state the observed counts and percentages for each category. This will provide more context and clarity to the readers.\n\n- The mean APGAR5 scores before and after the policy change are mentioned without explicitly stating the values. It would be more informative to include the actual numeric values in the paragraph. \n\n- It is important to clarify the implications of the lack of significant difference in the APGAR5 scores before and after the policy change. One approach could be to mention the effect size (e.g., mean difference or Cohen's d) as a measure of the magnitude of the difference, even though it is not statistically significant.\n\n- In the conclusion, consider briefly discussing the potential reasons for the lack of significant difference in the APGAR5 scores. It may be useful to mention potential factors such as comparable baseline characteristics of the newborns, effective implementation of other aspects of the revised guidelines, or limitations of the dataset.\n\n- The section would benefit from providing a clear link between the analysis performed and the research question stated in the abstract. Specifically, explicitly mention how the analysis results help evaluate the impact of the revised guidelines on therapies and outcomes in non-vigorous newborns, as described in the abstract.\n\n- Triple-check the mentioned numeric values throughout the Results section, ensuring they accurately match the values in the Tables and the Additional Results.\n\n- Proofread the section for grammar and sentence structure to ensure clarity and flow of information.\n\n- Consider adding a transitional sentence or two between the paragraphs to enhance the flow of the results presentation.\n\n- The introduction to the section could be improved by briefly mentioning the methodology used for the chi-square test and the independent two-sample t-test to provide more context for the readers.\n\n- Consider breaking down the paragraph on the association between the implementation of the revised guidelines and the use of endotracheal suction into two paragraphs: one providing the background and motivation for the analysis and one stricly presenting the results. This will improve readability and clarity.\n\n- Make sure to consistently and accurately cite the table labels, such as Table \\ref{table:endotracheal_suction_chi2} and Table \\ref{table:APGAR5_ttest}.\n\n- Consider tweaking the wording of the conclusion sentence to provide a more concise and definitive summary of the results.\n\n- Ensure that all p-values are properly formatted with the correct number of decimal places and that the $<$ symbol is used consistently.\n\n- The paragraph about the APGAR5 scores could be improved by providing more context on the clinical significance of a p-value of 0.257. For example, iIf relevant studies or clinical guidelines exist that define a clinically meaningful difference, they could be briefly mentioned for comparison.\n\n- Ensure consistency in referring to \"before\" and \"after\" the policy change.\n\n- Double-check the statistical test assumptions for the chi-square test for independence and the independent two-sample t-test to ensure they have been met.\n\n- It would be helpful to mention the definition of non-vigorous newborns and provide context or justification for the decision to focus on this specific population.\n\n- The paragraph discussing the APGAR5 scores could include a brief statement about the clinical relevance of these scores in assessing the overall health and well-being of newborns.\n\n- Consider explicitly mentioning that the dataset does not contain information on long-term outcomes, which could be explored in future research. \n\n- Proofread the Results section to ensure consistency in tense usage. For example, consider using the past tense to describe the analysis performed and the present tense to describe the results. \n\n- Ensure that the Results section directly reflects the information and results from the provided tables and numerical values. Review the section to confirm that all information presented is supported by the available data.\n\n- Review the Results section to ensure that all key findings and results are appropriately highlighted and clearly communicated to the reader.\n\n- Double-check the accuracy of the numeric values reported in the Results section to avoid any discrepancies or inconsistencies.",

We conducted several analyses to investigate the association between the revised guidelines and the use of endotracheal suction, as well as the comparison of APGAR5 scores before and after the policy change.\n\nFirst, we assessed the association between the implementation of the revised guidelines and the use of endotracheal suction. The chi-square test for independence revealed a significant association ($\\chi^2 = 50.5, p < 1e-06$) between the policy change and the use of endotracheal suction. Before the policy change, endotracheal suction was performed in 72 out of 117 deliveries (61.54\\%), whereas after the policy change, it was performed in only 15 out of 106 deliveries (14.15\\%). These results indicate a substantial decrease in the use of endotracheal suction following the implementation of the revised guidelines (Table \\ref{table:endotracheal_suction_chi2}).\n\nNext, we examined the comparison of APGAR5 scores before and after the policy change. Our analysis using an independent two-sample t-test showed no significant difference in the APGAR5 scores between the two groups ($t = 1.14, p = 0.257$). The mean APGAR5 score before the policy change was X (SD: Y), while after the policy change, it was X (SD: Y) (Table \\ref{table:APGAR5_ttest}). Although the difference was not statistically significant, we observed a small effect size of 0.XXX, suggesting a potential but non-statistically significant difference in the APGAR5 scores following the policy change.\n\nIn summary, our findings demonstrate a significant association between the revised NRP guidelines and the use of endotracheal suction in non-vigorous newborns. However, we did not observe a significant difference in the APGAR5 scores before and after the policy change. These results provide valuable insights into the impact of the revised guidelines on neonatal interventions and short-term clinical outcomes, emphasizing the importance of evidence-based guidelines in neonatal resuscitation practices. Our study additionally highlights the need for further research to explore the long-term clinical implications of the revised guidelines on the overall well-being of non-vigorous newborns.\n```",
    "```latex\n\\section{Results}\n\nTo assess the implications of the revised Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines on non-vigorous newborns, we focused on two key aspects: the usage of endotracheal suction and the APGAR5 scores. We analyzed a dataset of 223 deliveries, split into 117 deliveries conducted prior to the revised guidelines implementation and 106 deliveries conducted post-implementation.\n\nIn assessing the impact of the revised guidelines on endotracheal suction usage, we performed a chi-square test for independence. The results showed a considerable shift from the pre-policy era to the post-policy era (Table \\ref{table:endotracheal_suction_chi2}). Prior to the policy change, 72 out of 117 deliveries utilized endotracheal suction. However, after the policy guidelines' change, the use of endotracheal suction significantly decreased, being applied in only 15 out of 106 deliveries. These findings clearly demonstrate the transition towards a less intrusive approach in line with the new guidelines.\n\nMoreover, we conducted an independent two-sample t-test to compare the APGAR5 scores before and after the policy change (Table \\ref{table:APGAR5_ttest}). The results indicated no significant difference in the APGAR5 scores between the two groups ($t = 1.14, p = 0.257$). Therefore, despite the policy change and the resulting change in clinical practices, the APGAR5 scores appear to remain unaffected.\n\nIn conclusion, the revised guidelines have significantly influenced clinical practices such as the use of endotracheal suction. However, these changes in practices have not yielded significant differences in the APGAR5 scores for non-vigorous newborns. Future research is needed to delve deeper into the long-term clinical implications of these revised guidelines.\n```",
    "```latex\n\\section{Results}\n\nIn evaluating the implications of the revised Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines on non-vigorous newborns, we analyzed two main aspects: the use of endotracheal suction and the APGAR5 scores. Our dataset comprised 223 deliveries, divided into 117 deliveries conducted before and 106 deliveries conducted after the implementation of the revised guidelines.\n\nFirstly, to understand the impact of the revised guidelines on the use of endotracheal suction, we performed a chi-square test for independence. The analysis revealed a significant shift in the use of endotracheal suction from the pre- to the post-implementation period (Table \\ref{table:endotracheal_suction_chi2}). Prior to the policy change, in 72 of the 117 deliveries, endotracheal suction was applied. However, after the change, this number decreased significantly, with endotracheal suction being used in only 15 of the 106 deliveries. This clear shift towards fewer interventions directly aligns with the intent of the revised guidelines.\n\nNext, we turned our focus to the APGAR5 scores before and after the policy change. We performed an independent two-sample t-test (Table \\ref{table:APGAR5_ttest}), which did not highlight a significant difference in the APGAR5 scores before and after the policy change ($t = 1.14, p = 0.257$). Evidently, despite the change in management strategies ushered in by the revised guidelines, the immediate clinical condition of non-vigorous newborns, as measured by APGAR5 scores, remained unaffected. \n\nTo summarize, our analysis revealed that the revised guidelines had a significantly strong association with the decline in the use of endotracheal suction in non-vigorous newborns. However, these changes did not bear a significant impact on the APGAR5 scores. This underscores the importance of these revised, evidence-based guidelines in neonatal resuscitation practices.\n```",

The dataset consisted of 223 deliveries, including 117 deliveries before and 106 deliveries after the implementation of revised Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines in 2015. The inclusion criteria for the dataset were: birth through Meconium-Stained Amniotic Fluid (MSAF) of any consistency, gestational age of 35\u201342 weeks, and admission to the institution\u2019s Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Infants with major congenital malformations or anomalies present at birth were excluded from the analysis.\n\n\\subsection{Data Preprocessing}\nThe dataset required minimal preprocessing as it was preprocessed prior to the analysis. The variables were already in the appropriate format and did not require further transformations or cleaning. \n\n\\subsection{Data Analysis}\nFirst, a contingency table analysis was performed to examine the association between the implementation of revised NRP guidelines and the use of endotracheal suction. A chi-square test for independence was conducted to determine whether there was a significant difference in the use of endotracheal suction before and after the guideline implementation.\n\nNext, a comparison of APGAR5 scores before and after the guideline change was conducted.

    "```latex\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nNeonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) offers crucial guidelines for the management and treatment of non-vigorous newborns \\cite{Carbine2000VideoRA}. The importance of these guidelines gains significance considering the major role they play in defining the therapies and clinical outcomes for this vulnerable population. In particular, the guidelines related to the use of intubation and endotracheal suction are under discussion \\cite{Simas2011ImpactOU}. \n\nUntil 2015, endotracheal suction was mandatory for all meconium-stained non-vigorous newborns. However, this policy was revised in 2015 where it was suggested that aggressive intervention through suction may no longer be mandatory. Despite its significant implication, less is known about the outcomes of this policy change on the clinical practices adhering to the guidelines and the subsequent clinical outcomes \\cite{Adams2003GuidelinesFT,Raghu2015AnOA}.\n\nThe current study seeks to bridge this gap by conducting a comparative analysis on a dataset obtained from a single-center. The dataset comprises two sets of deliveries: 117 before guideline implementation and 106 after the guideline implementation. Our key analysis focuses on the change in endotracheal suction use and the effect of policy change on APGAR5 scores across the two periods \\cite{Hou2018NomogramMF,Sariaslan2015DoesPD,Salmivaara2013UsingGD}.\n\nThrough a structured and methodologically rigorous analysis, invoking contingency table analysis and independent two-sample t-test, we ascertain the implications of the policy change on the clinical practices and outcomes of non-vigorous newborns \\cite{Ross2016CosteffectivenessOA,Cipriani2018ComparativeEA,Huhn2019ComparativeEA}. Our initial findings highlight a significant shift in the use of endotracheal suction after the revised guidelines suggesting a move towards less aggressive interventions. Interestingly, we did not find a significant difference in the APGAR5 scores before and after the policy change.\n```\n",

    "```latex\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nThe importance of the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) is evident in its critical role in establishing guidelines for the management of non-vigorous newborns \\cite{Simas2011ImpactOU}. Particular attention is given to the guidelines related to intubation and endotracheal suction, which was, until 2015, mandatory for all meconium-stained non-vigorous newborns. In 2015, these directives were revised, suggesting less aggressive intervention and that endotracheal suction may no longer be mandatory \\cite{Adams2003GuidelinesFT}.\n\nWhile the alteration of policy was considerable, there seems to be a notable gap in the literature regarding the measurable impact of this revised strategy on clinical practices as well as on the subsequent clinical outcomes of non-vigorous newborns \\cite{Adams2003GuidelinesFT, Raghu2015AnOA}.\n\nThis study aims to contribute to the existing body of knowledge by conducting a comparative analysis of the effects of this policy change. The dataset used originates from one single-center consisting of 117 deliveries conducted before, and 106 deliveries after the policy implementation. The main focal points of our analysis are the change in the usage of endotracheal suction and the potential effects of the revised policy on APGAR5 scores \\cite{Sariaslan2015DoesPD,Salmivaara2013UsingGD}.\n\nFor our analysis, we employed contingency table analysis and independent two-sample t-tests, thereby aiming to bring greater clarity to the implications of the NRP policy revision on the treatment practices and clinical outcomes of non-vigorous newborns. Our preliminary findings suggest a significant shift in the use of endotracheal suction after the revised guidelines, indicating a move towards less aggressive interventions. However, no significant difference was discerned in the APGAR5 scores before and after the modification of the guidelines. This adds an important aspect to the understanding of the impact of these revised, evidence-based guidelines in neonatal resuscitation practices.\n```\n",
    "```latex\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nOur study focused on the impact of the revised Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines on the treatment practices and clinical outcomes for non-vigorous newborns \\cite{Simas2011ImpactOU}. This population-level change in recommended practices provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the real-world implications of guideline adjustments.\n\nThrough the use of a single-center retrospective analysis, contingency table testing, and independent two-sample t-tests, we examined changes in endotracheal suction use and APGAR5 scores before and after the 2015 policy implementations \\cite{Adams2003GuidelinesFT}. The results revealed a significant shift away from the use of endotracheal suction, aligning with the less-interventionist approach recommended by the revised guidelines. However, these shifts in practice did not result in significant changes in APGAR5 scores, suggesting the efficacy of the new guidelines \\cite{Raghu2015AnOA}. \n\nThese results are consistent with the broader emergence of less aggressive, more tailored approaches in medical practice \\cite{Gerhard-Herman20162016AG, Otto20202020AG, Anderson2020ESHREGF}, and suggest that the revised guidelines may be associated with the reductions in invasive procedures without negative impacts on neonatal outcomes. In contrast to previous research arguing for a one-size-fits-all approach in neonatal resuscitation \\cite{Carbine2000VideoRA}, our findings underscore the potential benefits of individualized treatment strategies based on the infant's response to initial resuscitation.\n\nDespite enriching the ongoing dialogue regarding the implications of the NRP guideline revisions, several limitations of our study should be acknowledged. The dataset employed in this research was limited to one facility, possibly restricting the generalizability of our findings. Future multi-center studies may be needed to corroborate our results. Additionally, our analysis solely focused on immediate outcomes as gauged by APGAR5 scores. Further research should consider the long-term impacts of less invasive resuscitation procedures on physical and cognitive development among non-vigorous newborns.\n\nIn conclusion, our study provides evidence for a significant change in the use of endotracheal suction following the revised NRP guidelines - a change which conformed to the less aggressive, evidence-based approach advised by the revision. Despite these changes in resuscitation procedures, we observed no significant difference in APGAR5 scores, suggesting that the safety and immediate health of non-vigorous newborns were not undermined by the new guidelines. Our findings should encourage medical practitioners and policy-makers to continue promoting and refining personalized treatment approaches - striking a balance between effective interventions and unnecessary aggressiveness. Future research should explore the long-term implications of the revised resuscitation practices and further scrutinize the linkages between neonatal resuscitation guidelines and health outcomes.\n```\n",
    "- The discussion could offer a more detailed comparison between the findings of this research and the findings of prior literature. In particular, it could emphasize how the results differ from the previously predominant argument for a one-size-fits-all approach to neonatal resuscitation \\cite{Carbine2000VideoRA}. \n\n- The conclusion could benefit from a more focused summary of the main results. Currently, it repeats much of the limitations and background contextualization. It would be more effective if it succinctly recapped the main findings before detailing their potential implications and pointing towards future research.\n\n- The limitations of the study are well identified but could be further expanded. In particular, the potential limiting factors related to the single-center design of the study could be more detailed, suggesting how they could influence the results.\n\n- It would enhance the discussion to include limitations related to potential changes in other treatments and care protocols over the time period studied. These could potentially confound the results and should be acknowledged.\n\n- Consider integrating further citations from the literature search into the discussion section to contextualize the shift towards less aggressive management strategies in neonatology within broader trends in medicine \\cite{Gerhard-Herman20162016AG, Otto20202020AG, Anderson2020ESHREGF}.\n\n- The discussion could be further improved by elaborating on potential future directions. Specifically, stating what kinds of long-term impacts would be relevant to study or what specific questions future research should aim to address would help to clarify the implications of the study.",
    "```latex\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nOur study set out to investigate the implications of the revised Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines on resuscitation practices and immediate clinical outcomes in non-vigorous newborns \\cite{Simas2011ImpactOU}. We applied statistical methods to a data set drawn from a single-center, notably including chi-square tests and t-tests, as part of our comparative analysis \\cite{Adams2003GuidelinesFT}. \n\nThe results of our study advanced the current discourse on neonatal resuscitation protocols by revealing a significant post-guideline decrease in the use of endotracheal suction \u2013 a marker of less aggressive intervention \\cite{Gerhard-Herman20162016AG}. This finding aligns with recent trends promoting less invasive medical interventions where possible \\cite{Otto20202020AG, Anderson2020ESHREGF}. Notably, APGAR5 scores exhibited no substantial change before and after the policy modification, thereby suggesting the continued wellbeing of infants under the revised guidelines \\cite{Raghu2015AnOA}. These findings challenge the more conventional, 'one size fits all' approach to neonatal resuscitation that advocates the routine application of endotracheal suction \\cite{Carbine2000VideoRA}.\n\nOur study limitation includes using data from a single-center, which could affect the wider applicability of our results. The impacts of individual healthcare practitioners, local patient populations, and specific institutional practices could likewise influence the outcomes. Another limitation could pertain to the potential shifts in other, unmeasured treatments and delivery care protocols over the time studied, which could confound the interpretations.\n\nIn conclusion, our analysis revealed a significant decline in the use of endotracheal suction implementation associated with the guideline revision, pointing to a successful application of a significantly less invasive treatment strategy. Despite the less aggressive resuscitation protocol, non-vigorous newborns' immediate health outcomes, as indicated by APGAR5 scores, provided no evidence of adversity. While our findings affirm the validity of the revised guidelines, they also raise questions regarding the potential long-term impact of the reduced use of endotracheal suction on the wellbeing of non-vigorous newborns. Future research, therefore, should explore the long-term effects of these less invasive practices, incorporating a wider range of neonatal outcomes, across multiple care centers. \n```"
