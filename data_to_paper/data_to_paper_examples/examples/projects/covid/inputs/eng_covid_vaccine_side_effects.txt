#1 "PortionNum" - the number of inoculated vaccine portions (1, 2, 3 or 4).
#2 "SideEffectStartTime" - the delay between the vaccination and side effect (999 means 'continuous'), measured in time units indicated in `DetailsStartTimeType`.
#3 "DetailsStartTimeType" - the time unit used for `SideEffectStartTime` ('seconds', 'minutes', 'hours', 'days', 'weeks', 'months', NaN).
#4 "SideEffectDurationTime" - the duration of the side effect (999 means 'continuous'), measured in time units indicated in `DetailsDurationTimeType`.
#5 "DetailsDurationTimeType" - the time unit used for `SideEffectDurationTime` ('seconds', 'minutes', 'hours', 'days', 'weeks', 'continuous', NaN).
#6 "Effect" - the specific side effect that was reported by the medical staff
