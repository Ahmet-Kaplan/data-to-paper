\title{Impact of Revised Neonatal Resuscitation Program Guidelines on Clinical Outcomes in Non-Vigorous Newborns}
\author{Data to Paper}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}Neonatal resuscitation guidelines are crucial for determining the care of non-vigorous newborns. In 2015, significant revisions were made to the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines, shifting towards less aggressive interventions based on initial resuscitation response. However, the impact of these revised guidelines on clinical outcomes remains unclear. To address this, we conducted a retrospective study comparing the therapies and outcomes of non-vigorous newborns before and after the guideline implementation. Our analysis of a dataset comprising 223 deliveries revealed significant findings. Following the policy change, there was a decrease in the application of positive pressure ventilation (PPV), suggesting a shift towards less aggressive interventions. Additionally, the policy change was associated with potential increases in the length of stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). However, caution must be exercised in interpreting these results due to the retrospective nature of the study and the data being from a single center. Our study contributes valuable insights into the impact of the revised NRP guidelines on clinical outcomes in non-vigorous newborns, underscoring the need for further research and potential implications for clinical practice.\end{abstract}
\section*{Introduction}

Neonatal resuscitation is a critical aspect of neonatal care, particularly for newborns who exhibit lower vigor at birth, commonly referred to as "non-vigorous" newborns \cite{Wyckoff2015Part1N}. These infants, often born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF), may need immediate interventions such as endotracheal suction and positive pressure ventilation (PPV) \cite{Chawla2020PerinatalNeonatalMO}. Adherence to standard guidelines, like that of the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP), is crucial for the immediate care of these newborns. These guidelines, however, underwent substantial revisions in 2015, transitioning to a less aggressive intervention approach \cite{Wyckoff2015Part1N}, leaving an open question on the potential implications of these changes on the therapeutic and clinical outcomes in non-vigorous newborns \cite{Myers2020ImpactOT}.

Evaluations of the NRP revision have primarily focused on the immediate or short-term outcomes such as Apgar scores and respiratory support requirements \cite{Myers2020ImpactOT}. There is a growing body of studies reporting beneficial outcomes associated with changes in healthcare guidelines \cite{Srenby2019ReducingRI,Goud2009EffectOG,Tapsell2017EffectOI}. However, these studies have not specifically evaluated the revised NRP guidelines in terms of their long-term impact on clinical outcomes such as PPV and endotracheal suction application, antibiotic usage duration, and length of stay (LOS) in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).

Addressing this gap, our study utilizes a comprehensive dataset derived from a single-center retrospective study, capturing the breadth and depth of therapeutic interventions and clinical outcomes among non-vigorous newborns admitted to NICU across 223 deliveries \cite{Chandrasekharan2020NeonatalRA, Johnson2020HeartRA}. This dataset, with its granularity and specific focus, offers an unprecedented opportunity to study the nuanced effects of the revised NRP guidelines.

Our methodology incorporates a range of modern statistical methods to comprehensively analyze differences in key clinical parameters before and after guideline implementation \cite{Rossi2021KnowledgeGE,VanderWeele2014OnTC}. Precisely, our study evaluates the implementation of the revised guidelines on PPV and endotracheal suction, duration of antibiotic usage, and NICU stay. The results provide new insights that could guide the improvement of neonatal care practices and contribute to enhancing the survival outcomes for non-vigorous newborns.

\section*{Results}

To examine the impact of the revised Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines on clinical outcomes in non-vigorous newborns, we conducted a retrospective study analyzing a dataset comprising 223 deliveries. We compared therapies and outcomes before and after the guideline implementation, focusing on the application of positive pressure ventilation (PPV), endotracheal suction, the duration of antibiotics, and the length of stay. Descriptive statistics before and after the 2015 policy change are presented in Table \ref{table:desc_stats}.

First, we investigated the association between the policy change and the application of PPV. Our regression analysis shows a significant negative association ($\beta = -0.122$, $p$-value = 0.0254), indicating that after the policy change, there was a decrease in the application of PPV. We found that Apgar score at 1 minute after birth ($\beta = -0.112$, $p$-value $<$ $10^{-6}$) and the use of oxygen therapy ($\beta = 0.14$, $p$-value = 0.0479) were also associated with the application of PPV (Table \ref{table:policy_ppv}).

\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}


Next, we examined the association between the policy change and the length of stay (LOS) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Our regression analysis identified several factors associated with LOS, including the policy change. The policy change was associated with a significantly longer LOS ($\beta = 34.9$, $p$-value = 0.0196), indicating that after the policy change, newborns had a longer stay in the NICU. Other significant factors included maternal age, gestational age at birth, Apgar score at 1 minute and 5 minutes after birth, the presence of respiratory distress syndrome, the use of surfactant, and the severity of neonatal acute physiology assessment (SNAPPE-II score) (Table \ref{table:policy_los}).

\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}


Finally, we examined the association between the policy change and the duration of antibiotics. Our regression analysis revealed that the policy change was not significantly associated with antibiotics duration. However, we found that the presence of prolonged rupture of membranes ($\beta = 1.36$, $p$-value = 0.0257), chorioamnionitis ($\beta = 1.42$, $p$-value = 0.0102), the presence of meconium aspiration syndrome ($\beta = 1.41$, $p$-value = 0.0365), and the severity of the neonatal acute physiology assessment (SNAPPE-II score) ($\beta = 0.0522$, $p$-value = 0.0131) were significantly associated with the duration of antibiotics (Table \ref{table:policy_ad}).

\end{table}


In summary, our results demonstrate that the revised NRP guidelines were associated with a decrease in the application of PPV and an increase in the length of stay in non-vigorous newborns. However, the duration of antibiotics was not significantly affected by the policy change. These findings provide important insights into the impact of the revised NRP guidelines and highlight the complexity of clinical outcomes in non-vigorous newborns. Further discussion and interpretation of these results will be presented in the following section.

\section*{Discussion}

The focus of this study was to scrutinize the impact of revised Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines on the clinical outcomes in non-vigorous newborns. The significance of these efforts are recognized in the context of the vital role of neonatal resuscitation for newborns conveying lower vigor at birth \cite{Chawla2020PerinatalNeonatalMO, Bera2014EffectOK, Wyckoff2015Part1N}. The NRP guidelines underwent a crucial revision in 2015, shifting the course of intervention to a less aggressive approach. While previous evaluations of the revision largely concentrated on immediate outcomes like Apgar scores \cite{Myers2020ImpactOT}, our study integrates analysis of long-term effects such as NICU stay duration and antibiotic usage period \cite{Rossi2021KnowledgeGE, VanderWeele2014OnTC}.

Our data analysis, drawn from a single-center retrospective study, exhibited a significant reduction in the application of positive pressure ventilation (PPV), post the guideline revisions \cite{Chandrasekharan2020NeonatalRA}. This concurs with the findings of other studies, such as Myers et al., emphasizing a decrease in imposed respiratory support \cite{Myers2020ImpactOT}. Nonetheless, this research provides a distinctive perspective through the identification of an extended duration of NICU stay subsequent to the revised guidelines. This finding spotlights a critical implication for healthcare planning, demanding careful allocation of resources for optimal neonatal outcomes \cite{Jennings2011TaskSI}.

Despite the revelations presented, the study is confined by its retrospective design and use of single-center data, effectively restricting the generalizability of its results. The potential confounders such as disparities in maternal age, diverse birth circumstances, varying degrees of meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and the broad range of gestational age at birth could influence the outcomes. Moreover, the size of the dataset, encompassing 223 deliveries, may limit the statistical power of the findings. Consequently, future studies should aim to mitigate these issues by involving larger, more diverse samples, possibly through multicenter collaborations.

Upon comparing the unique outcomes of this study with prior literature, the findings underscore how healthcare guidelines serve as a dynamic tool, the revisions of which profoundly impact clinical practices and patient outcomes \cite{Srenby2019ReducingRI,Goud2009EffectOG,Tapsell2017EffectOI}. Our research, while supporting known benefits of reduced aggressive interventions, also highlights unforeseen consequences such as prolonged NICU stays. 

In conclusion, this study provides key insights into the impact of the 2015 NRP guideline revisions on the healthcare practices and clinical outcomes for non-vigorous newborns. It signifies the decreased application of PPV and emphasizes an unexpected increase in NICU stay durations. Future research, employing larger samples and multicenter studies, could further enhance the robustness of these insights by addressing the limitations of the current study. Furthermore, prospective, randomized controlled trials could be considered to evaluate causality and to provide a comprehensive understanding of neonatal outcomes. This holistic understanding can serve to effectively optimize these crucial guidelines and enhance the clinical care for non-vigorous newborns.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Data Source}
The data used in this study were obtained from a single-center retrospective study comparing Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) therapies and clinical outcomes of non-vigorous newborns before and after the implementation of the revised Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines in 2015. The dataset included 117 deliveries pre-guideline implementation and 106 deliveries post-guideline implementation. Inclusion criteria for the study were birth through Meconium-Stained Amniotic Fluid (MSAF) of any consistency, gestational age of 35–42 weeks, and admission to the institution’s NICU. Infants with major congenital malformations/anomalies present at birth were excluded from the study.

\subsection*{Data Preprocessing}
Prior to the analysis, the dataset was preprocessed using Python. Missing values in the numeric variables were imputed with the mean value of the respective column. Categorical variables were converted into binary indicator variables using one-hot encoding. The preprocessing steps performed in the analysis were specifically aimed at handling missing values and converting categorical variables to a suitable format for further analysis.

\subsection*{Data Analysis}
The data analysis was conducted using various statistical methods provided by the Python libraries. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the pre and post guideline groups. A group-wise comparison was performed to evaluate the differences in clinical treatment and outcomes before and after the policy change. To determine the association between the policy change and specific variables, linear regression analysis was performed using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method. Separate regression models were fitted for variables including positive pressure ventilation (PPV), length of stay in the NICU, and antibiotics duration. The policy change (pre vs post) was used as the independent variable in the regression models, and relevant outcome variables were used as the dependent variables. For each regression analysis, the coefficients and p-values were obtained, and variables with p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

The statistical analyses performed in this study provided insights into the impact of the revised NRP guidelines on clinical outcomes in non-vigorous newborns. However, it is important to note that the results should be interpreted with caution due to the retrospective nature of the study and the data being derived from a single-center study. Further research with larger sample sizes and multicenter studies are warranted to validate and generalize the findings.\subsection*{Code Availability}

\subsection{Code Description}

The purpose of this code is to perform data exploration on the given dataset and generate a report in a text file format. The code performs several analysis steps to gain insights about the dataset.

1. Data Loading: The code reads the dataset from a CSV file.

2. Data Size: The code calculates the number of rows and columns in the dataset and writes this information to the "data\_exploration.txt" file.

3. Summary Statistics: The code computes summary statistics for key numerical variables including maternal age (AGE), birth weight (BirthWeight), gestational age (GestationalAge), and length of stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (LengthStay). The summary statistics include count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, quartiles, and maximum values. These statistics provide an overview of the distribution of these variables in the dataset and are written to the "data\_exploration.txt" file.

4. Categorical Variables: The code identifies the categorical variables in the dataset and for each categorical variable, it determines the most common values and their frequency. The top 5 most common values for each categorical variable are written to the "data\_exploration.txt" file. This information helps in understanding the distribution and prevalence of different categories in the dataset.

5. Missing Values: The code calculates the total number of missing values in the dataset by summing up the counts of null values in each column. The total number of missing values is written to the "data\_exploration.txt" file. Identifying missing values is important as they can impact the validity of data analysis and may require appropriate handling during subsequent stages.

6. Check for Special Numeric Values: The code checks for special numeric values in the dataset, specifically 0s. It identifies columns where 0s are present and writes the column names along with the count of 0s to the "data\_exploration.txt" file. This step helps to identify potential issues such as missing data marked as 0s.

7. Extra Summary: Pearson Correlation Among Key Numerical Variables: The code calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient among key numerical variables including maternal age (AGE), birth weight (BirthWeight), gestational age (GestationalAge), and length of stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (LengthStay). The correlation matrix is written to the "data\_exploration.txt" file. This measure helps to understand the strength and direction of the linear relationship between these variables.

Overall, this code performs various data exploration steps to analyze the dataset and provides valuable insights about the distribution of variables, missing data, categorical distributions, and correlations between key numerical variables.

\subsection{Code Description}

The given code performs data analysis on the dataset "meconium\_nicu\_dataset\_preprocessed\_short.csv" to assess the effects of a change in Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines on Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) therapies and clinical outcomes of non-vigorous newborns. 

The code starts by loading the dataset and preparing it for analysis. The missing values in numeric columns are filled with the mean values. 

Descriptive statistics are then calculated for the pre- and post-guideline implementation periods. The mean values of Positive Pressure Ventilation (PPV), Endotracheal Suction, Antibiotics Duration, and Length of Stay are calculated and stored in a DataFrame. The resulting DataFrame is then saved as "table\_0.pkl".

Next, the dataset is preprocessed by one-hot encoding categorical variables such as Mode of Delivery, Sepsis, Gender, Meconium Consistency, and Reason for Admission. 

The analysis is performed using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. The independent variables (X) include all numeric columns except the target variables (PPV, Endotracheal Suction, Antibiotics Duration, and Length of Stay). A constant term is added to the independent variables. 

Three separate regression models are fit for PPV, Length of Stay, and Antibiotics Duration with respect to the policy change variable (PrePost) and the other independent variables. The coefficient estimates and p-values for the policy change variable are extracted, and a DataFrame is created to store the significant coefficients and their corresponding p-values. These DataFrames are saved as "table\_1.pkl", "table\_2.pkl", and "table\_3.pkl" for PPV, Length of Stay, and Antibiotics Duration, respectively. 

Finally, the code calculates additional results, including the total number of observations and the accuracy of the regression model. These results are stored as a dictionary and saved in "additional\_results.pkl".

Overall, the code conducts statistical analysis to investigate the association between the policy change and various outcomes in non-vigorous newborns, providing insights into the impact of the NRP guideline change on NICU therapies and clinical outcomes.
