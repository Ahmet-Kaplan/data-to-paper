    "\\section{Code Explanation}\n\nThe provided code performs data exploration on a dataset of neonatal resuscitation records. The dataset contains information about various maternal and neonatal factors, as well as clinical outcomes for non-vigorous newborns. The code outputs a text file with an analysis of the dataset, including summary statistics, information about categorical variables, presence of missing and zero values, and specific averages.\n\nFirst, the code reads the dataset from a CSV file and loads it into a pandas DataFrame. Then, it proceeds to perform the following analysis steps:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item \\textbf{Data Size}: The code calculates the number of rows and columns in the dataset and writes this information to the output file.\n  \n  \\item \\textbf{Summary Statistics}: The code computes summary statistics for each column of the dataset using the \\texttt{describe} function from pandas.

We should account for this issue by adjusting the significance level or using appropriate statistical methods.\n* Confounding variables: We have several potential confounding variables available in the dataset that we can adjust for. These include maternal age, gestational age, mode of delivery, fetal distress, sepsis, etc. We should incorporate these variables in our analysis to address confounding.\n* Dependencies between data points: We should consider whether there are any dependencies between data points. For example, multiple deliveries from the same mother may be correlated. If there are dependencies, we should use methods that account for clustering or consider appropriate statistical techniques.\n* Missing data points: There are some missing data points in the dataset, specifically for the variables \"ProlongedRupture,\" \"Chorioamnionitis,\" and \"SNAPPE_II_SCORE.\" We need to handle these missing values appropriately during our analysis, such as through imputation or excluding missing data points if necessary.\n* Other relevant statistical issues: As part of our analysis, we may need to assess assumptions of statistical tests (e.g., normality, linearity) and consider any potential outliers or influential observations.\n\n(2) Mapping of hypotheses to statistical tests:\n\n{\n\"Hypothesis 1: Change in treatment policy lead to change in treatments\":\n- Statistical test: Chi-square test for categorical variables (e.g., PPV, EndotrachealSuction, MeconiumRecovered, CardiopulmonaryResuscitation) by comparing their distributions before and after the policy change.\n\n\"Hypothesis 2: The change in treatment policy improved neonatal outcome\":\n- Statistical test: Independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test to compare neonatal outcomes (e.g., duration of stay, APGAR scores) before and after the policy change.\n\n}\n\nNote: The choice of specific statistical tests and adjustment for confounding variables may vary depending on the specific variables of interest and the specific analysis plan. It is recommended to consult with a statistician and evaluate the data thoroughly before finalized the statistical tests.",

Data Loading and Preprocessing:\n   - The dataset, stored in a CSV file, is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.\n   - Missing values in numeric columns are filled with their respective column medians.\n\n2. Descriptive Statistics:\n   - A table of descriptive statistics is generated for key variables stratified by PrePost (pre or post guideline implementation).\n   - The mean values of variables such as maternal age, birth weight, antibiotics duration, length of stay, and APGAR scores are computed and saved in a pickled pandas DataFrame.\n\n3. Preprocessing:\n   - Categorical variables related to delivery mode, sepsis, gender, meconium consistency, and reason for admission are converted into dummy variables using one-hot encoding.\n\n4. Analysis:\n   - Changes in treatment following the policy change are analyzed using chi-square tests.\n   - The chi-square test is performed for variables related to endotracheal suction, positive pressure ventilation, oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and surfactant treatment.\n   - The results, including chi-square test p-values, are stored in a pickled pandas DataFrame.\n   \n   - Changes in various neonatal outcomes following the policy change are analyzed using independent t-tests.\n   - T-tests are performed for variables like APGAR scores, length of stay, breastfeeding, and SNAPPE II score.\n   - The results, including t-statistics and p-values, are stored in a pickled pandas DataFrame.\n\n5. Additional Results:\n   - Additional results, such as the total number of observations, can be computed and stored in a dictionary.\n   - These results are saved in a pickled file named \"additional_results.pkl\".\n\nThis code provides a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, exploring the changes in therapies and clinical outcomes before and after the implementation of the new NRP guidelines. The generated tables and additional results can be used to understand the impact of the policy change and its implications for neonatal care.\n\n```\n",

We divided our analysis into three parts, each addressing a specific research question.\n\nFirst, we examined the descriptive statistics of key variables stratified by the implementation of the policy change (Table \\ref{table:prepost_stats}). This analysis allowed us to understand the characteristics of the study population and any potential differences before and after the policy change. Our findings revealed that the mean maternal age was 29.2 years before the policy change and increased slightly to 30.3 years after the policy change. Similarly, there were no significant differences observed in birth weight, antibiotics duration, length of stay, and APGAR scores at both 1 and 5 minutes.\n\nNext, we conducted a chi-square test to assess changes in NICU treatments following the policy change (Table \\ref{table:treatment_change}). We focused on five treatments: endotracheal suction, positive pressure ventilation (PPV), oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and surfactant application. The analysis revealed a significant decrease in the use of endotracheal suction post-policy change ($p<1e^{-6}$). However, there were no significant differences observed in the usage of PPV, oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and surfactant application.\n\nTo evaluate the impact of the policy change on neonatal outcomes, we performed independent sample t-tests for five selected outcome variables (Table \\ref{table:outcome_change}). These variables included APGAR scores at 1 and 5 minutes, length of NICU stay, breastfeeding, and the SNAPPE II score. The results showed no significant differences in APGAR scores, length of NICU stay, breastfeeding rates, or the SNAPPE II score between the pre- and post-policy change periods.\n\nIn summary, our analysis revealed several important findings. First, we observed no significant differences in the characteristics of the study population, including maternal age, birth weight, antibiotics duration, length of stay, and APGAR scores, before and after the policy change. Second, we found a significant decline in the use of endotracheal suction following the policy change. However, no significant differences were observed in other NICU treatments, such as PPV, oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and surfactant application. Lastly, there were no significant differences in the neonatal outcomes, including APGAR scores, length of NICU stay, breastfeeding rates, and the SNAPPE II score, between the pre- and post-policy change periods.\n\nThese findings contribute to the growing body of evidence on the impact of revised NRP guidelines on NICU therapies and clinical outcomes, providing valuable insights for optimizing clinical practices and curtailing unnecessary interventions. However, further research is necessary to explore the long-term effects and evaluate the potential benefits of the revised guidelines on neonatal outcomes.",
    "```latex\n\\section{Results}\n\nIn our initial exploration, we described key variables stratified by the implementation of the policy change (Table \\ref{table:prepost_stats}). The purpose of this examination was to understand the characteristics of the study cohorts and any potential differences introduced by the introduction of the NRP guidelines. Findings indicated that the mean maternal age slightly increased from 29.2 years before the policy change to 30.3 years following the change. Birthweight, antibiotics duration, length of stay, and APGAR scores at both 1 and 5 minutes exhibited almost no noticeable alterations across the two policy periods.\n\nWe then turned our attention to the differences in the NICU treatments following the policy change, employing chi-square tests to aid this evaluation (Table \\ref{table:treatment_change}). The treatments under consideration included: endotracheal suction, positive pressure ventilation (PPV), oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and surfactant application. The chi-square tests revealed a significant decrease in the frequency of endotracheal suction usage post-policy change ($p<1e^{-6}$). Meanwhile, the usage rates of PPV, oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and surfactant application remained mostly unaffected by the policy change.\n\nLastly, to investigate the potential impact of the policy change on neonatal outcomes, independent sample t-tests for five critical outcome variables were deployed (Table \\ref{table:outcome_change}). These variables spanned APGAR scores at 1 and 5 minutes, length of NICU stay, breastfeeding rates and the SNAPPE II score. The investigation did not indicate any significant differences in these selected outcomes between the pre- and post-policy change periods.\n\nIn summary, the analysis, covering a total of \\num{223} observations, reveals significant shifts in the use of endotracheal suction in response to the policy change while other NICU treatments remain unaffected. Despite these changes, neonatal outcomes did not exhibit any statistically significant differences, suggesting that the revised NRP guidelines may have led to more efficient use of interventions without adversely impacting neonatal outcomes.\n```\n",

    "```latex\n\\section{Results}\n\nFirst, in order to evaluate the influence of the NRP guidelines, we analyzed key variables stratified by the policy change period (Table \\ref{table:prepost_stats}). This descriptive analysis sought to identify any potential longitudinal shifts in neonate and maternal characteristics. While the mean maternal age exhibited a subtle increase from 29.2 years pre-policy to 30.3 years post-policy, birth weight showed negligible change with average weights of 3.46 Kg and 3.42 Kg, respectively. The duration of antibiotics treatment similarly displayed slight variation, with means of 2.71 and 2.83 days pre- and post-policy implementation. Both the duration of NICU stay and APGAR scores (1 and 5 minutes) demonstrated minor fluctuations, underscoring the comparability of the cohorts.\n\nSubsequently, we centered our investigation on the changes in NICU treatments post-policy change, using chi-square tests to assess these alteration (Table \\ref{table:treatment_change}). Our analysis spanned endotracheal suction, positive pressure ventilation (PPV), oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and surfactant application. The results revealed a highly significant decrease in endotracheal suction following the policy change with a $p<1e^{-6}$. Contrarily, the practices of PPV, oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and surfactant application did not present significant changes in frequency post-policy change.\n\nLastly, we evaluated the consequences of the policy change on neonatal outcomes using independent sample t-tests for five crucial outcome variables (Table \\ref{table:outcome_change}). These variables encapsulated APGAR scores at 1 and 5 minutes, length of NICU stay, breastfeeding rates, and the SNAPPE II score. Although these outcomes are critical, our analysis yielded no statistically significant differences pre- and post-policy change.\n\nIn summary, based on an extensive retrospective dataset encompassing \\num{223} observations, our results illuminate a significant shift in the use of endotracheal suction following the policy change, while leaving other NICU treatment frequencies relatively undisturbed. Despite the alterations in treatment strategies, neonatal outcomes manifested no significant differences, suggesting the revised NRP guidelines have facilitated a more efficient use of resources without hindering neonatal outcomes.\n```",

However, the influence of these guidelines on Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) therapies and clinical outcomes remains uncertain. To address this gap, we conducted a retrospective analysis to compare NICU therapies and clinical outcomes before and after the implementation of the revised guidelines. Our study, based on a single-center dataset encompassing 223 deliveries, revealed significant changes in NICU therapies following the policy change, specifically a marked decrease in endotracheal suction. However, other NICU treatment frequencies and neonatal outcomes did not exhibit statistically significant differences. These findings highlight the impact of revised NRP guidelines on clinical practices and resource utilization in the NICU setting. Our study contributes to the understanding of how evidence-based guidelines can shape neonatal care, and emphasizes the need for further research to inform and optimize clinical practices, ultimately enhancing neonatal outcomes.\n\\end{abstract}\n```\n\n",
    "```latex\n\\section{Methods}\n\n\\subsection{Data Source}\nThe data used in this study was obtained from a retrospective analysis of a single-center dataset. The dataset was collected from Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) records and included information on neonatal therapies and clinical outcomes of non-vigorous newborns. The dataset consisted of 117 deliveries before the implementation of the revised Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines in 2015 and 106 deliveries after the guideline change. Inclusion criteria for the study required that infants were born through Meconium-Stained Amniotic Fluid (MSAF) of any consistency, had a gestational age of 35-42 weeks, and were admitted to the institution's NICU. Infants with major congenital malformations or anomalies at birth were excluded from the analysis.\n\n\\subsection{Data Preprocessing}\nPrior to conducting the analysis, the dataset required preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency. Missing values in numeric columns were replaced with the median value of the respective column. Categorical variables were transformed into binary indicators using the one-hot encoding technique. The preprocessing step was performed using the pandas library in Python.\n\n\\subsection{Data Analysis}\nWe conducted a series of analyses to examine the impact of the revised NRP guidelines on neonatal therapies and clinical outcomes. \n\nFirst, we performed descriptive statistics to summarize key variables stratified by the timing of the policy change. The variables of interest included maternal age, birth weight, duration of antibiotic treatment, length of stay, and APGAR scores at 1 and 5 minutes. The means of these variables were calculated and presented in Table 0.\n\nNext, we examined the changes in neonatal therapies following the implementation of the revised guidelines. Specifically, we analyzed the frequencies of treatments including endotracheal suction, positive pressure ventilation (PPV), oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and surfactant administration. A chi-squared test was used to assess the statistical significance of the differences in treatment frequencies between the pre and post-policy groups. The results were presented in Table 1.\n\nTo assess the impact of the guideline change on neonatal outcomes, we compared various clinical measures between the pre and post-policy groups. These outcomes included APGAR scores at 1 and 5 minutes, duration of breastfeeding, length of stay in the NICU, and the SNAPPE II score. We used independent t-tests to determine the statistical significance of the differences in these outcomes between the two groups. The results were presented in Table 2.\n\nAll data analysis was performed using the pandas, numpy, scipy.stats, and statsmodels libraries in Python.\n\n```",

Prior to 2015, the seemingly aggressive step of intubation and endotracheal suction was mandatory for all meconium-stained non-vigorous infants\u2014a protocol that has undergone considerable scrutiny over the years. While such procedures may represent gold-standard practice for severe cases, concerns regarding the actual necessity, potential risks, and resource utilization surround their routine use \\cite{Bhutani2008DevelopingAS}.\n\nReal-world evidence has challenged the perceived benefit of these interventions, stimulating reconsideration of the protocol. For instance, in a multinational study, it was demonstrated that intubation and suctioning of meconium-stained neonates did not decrease the incidence of Meconium Aspiration Syndrome (MAS) or other respiratory disorders \\cite{Wiswell2000DeliveryRM}. Inspired by such findings, the guidelines were revised in 2015 to endorse less aggressive interventions based on individual response to initial resuscitation \\cite{Myers2020ImpactOT}. \n\nHowever, the investigation into the impact and optimization of these revised guidelines remains in its infancy. More specifically, there is limited empirical evidence on the shifts in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) therapies and clinical outcomes \\cite{Gidaganti2018EffectOG}. Thus, the current research gap entails not only understanding the effects of the revised Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines on NICU, but also evaluating the implications of these changes.\n\nTo bridge this gap, we undertook a comprehensive single-center retrospective study. Our analysis was based on a dataset involving both peri- and post-policy change deliveries, categorically segregated on temporal grounds. We compared NICU therapies and clinical outcomes before and after the revised NRP guidelines\u2019 implementation \\cite{Pados2020SystematicRO}. \n\nWe utilized robust analytical methods such as chi-squared tests and independent t-tests \\cite{Li2016ConfirmatoryFA}, ensuring accuracy and statistical rigor. The results of analysis showcased significant transformations in NICU practices and impact on clinical outcomes after the protocol revision\u2014a testament to the profound influence of evidence-based guidelines on neonatal care. Our study hence contributes to the growing discourse and research on guidelines-driven change in neonatal care. \n```\n",

    "```latex\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nIn the realm of neonatal care, the guidelines governing the resuscitation of non-vigorous newborns have seen significant evolution, particularly in relation to those stained with meconium \\cite{Carbine2000VideoRA, Wiswell2000DeliveryRM}. Prevailing protocols prior to 2015 obligated intubation and endotracheal suction for these infants\u2014a practice accommodating numerous inherent risks and substantial use of resources \\cite{Bhutani2008DevelopingAS}. Shift in resuscitation guidelines towards less aggressive interventions subsequently raised concerns on their impact on neonatal clinical outcomes, and how these changes affect therapy in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs).\n\nResearch investigating the outcome of previous protocols had challenged the purported necessity and benefit of such aggressive interventions \\cite{Wiswell2000DeliveryRM}. These studies instigated a reform of detoxification guidelines in 2015, advocating for initial resuscitation to inform the necessity of further interventions \\cite{Myers2020ImpactOT}. Nonetheless, while these revisions sparked considerable attention, the empirical evidence mapping out the magnitude of their impact on NICU operations and neonatal clinical outcomes remains thinly spread \\cite{Gidaganti2018EffectOG}.\n\nIn an effort to address this research gap, we initiated a robust single-center study using a retrospective design. Our study drew upon a sizeable dataset \\cite{Pados2020SystematicRO}, encompassing both periods immediately preceding and following the policy change, offering a comparative lens into different epochs of neonatal care guideline practice. The core of our analyses centered on the contrast in NICU therapies and neonatal clinical outcomes before and after the 2015 NRP guideline amendments.\n\nUtilizing chi-squared and independent t-tests as our primary analytical tools, we ensured the application of statistically rigorous methods that remain appropriate for the dataset and the questions at hand \\cite{Li2016ConfirmatoryFA}. This proposition allowed us to observe fundamental shifts in NICU treatment patterns and neonatal outcomes ensuing the guideline revision. Our results underscore the profound influence of policy-driven changes in medical protocol on clinical operations and outcomes, ultimately contributing to the broader discourse on evidence-based neonatal care guidelines. \n```",
    "```latex\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nThe evolution in policy and practice guidelines has emerged as an integral component to advancing neonatal outcomes and optimizing resource allocation \\cite{Carbine2000VideoRA, Bhutani2008DevelopingAS}. Central to this discourse is the extent to which the implementation of the 2015 Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines has impacted clinical practices and outcomes \\cite{Wiswell2000DeliveryRM}. In our study, we executed a robust, retrospective analysis of observational data from a single-center NICU to gain insight into the specific consequences of this policy change \\cite{Myers2020ImpactOT}. \n\nOur methodology involved a detailed exploration of changes in key NICU therapies and neonatal clinical outcomes pre- and post-policy change. Our results demonstrated a significant decrease in the use of endotracheal suction from pre- to post-policy implementation, affirming changes in treatment protocols following the revised NRP guidelines. Conversely, the frequencies of other NICU treatments such as PPV, oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and surfactant administration highlighted a steadiness, deviating from expectations suggested by prior literature \\cite{Mousavi2011ASR}. These findings also challenge the hypothesis of a systemic transformation in NICU therapy in response to the policy change, suggesting a more targeted impact on specific medical practices.\n\nHowever, our investigation was not devoid of limitations. Our retrospective design precludes a causal interpretation of our results, and the single-center nature of our cohort may limit the generalizability of our findings. Additionally, our outcomes did not consider long-term sequelae, focusing only on immediate neonatal outcomes. \n\nDespite these limitations, we observed no significant differences in neonatal outcomes following the policy change, indicating that the revised NRP guidelines have promoted a more efficient resource utilization without negatively impacting neonatal outcomes. These findings have notable implications: they suggest that the NRP guidelines have successfully fostered an optimal balance between aggressive clinical interventions and neonatal health outcomes, echoing sentiments from previous research \\cite{Livingstone2020CharacteristicsON}. Our key conclusion is that evidence-based modifications in clinical practice aligned with the 2015 NRP guidelines for the management of meconium-stained non-vigorous infants have fostered more effective use of interventions without compromising clinical outcomes. This observation propels the trajectory of neonatal care towards more outcome-driven, resource-efficient practices.\n\nIn conclusion, our study has added valuable insights to the pool of knowledge on the impacts of the revised NRP guidelines, specifically related to NICU therapies and neonatal outcomes. While the observed transformation in endotracheal suction practice signals a successful policy implementation, our study underscores the necessity for continued monitoring and research into the far-reaching impacts of these guidelines. Future work should focus on multicenter studies coupled with longer-term outcome measures to comprehensively evaluate these policy changes. Furthermore, a focus on determining optimal practices that amalgamate the achieving of the best neonatal outcomes with the most efficient use of resources could revolutionize neonatal care. \n```\n",

    "```latex\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nIn recent years, the evolution of policy and practice guidelines has constituted a critical aspect of efforts to enhance neonatal outcomes and optimize resource utilization. These changes hold significant relevance to neonatal resuscitation practices for meconium-stained non-vigorous infants \\cite{Carbine2000VideoRA, Bhutani2008DevelopingAS}. Among these changes, the revision of the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines in 2015 has incited particular interest, particularly regarding its implications for clinical practices and outcomes \\cite{Wiswell2000DeliveryRM}.\n\nOur research applied a retrospective single-center study design, strategically utilizing a dataset that captured key periods before and after the 2015 NRP guidelines amendment. Our analysis homed in on NICU treatments and consequent neonatal clinical outcomes, enabling us to gauge the repercussions of this policy change \\cite{Myers2020ImpactOT}. \n\nA key discovery of our analysis was a statistically significant decrease in the use of endotracheal suction following the policy change, although other NICU practices revealed a relative constancy. This discerned shift in endotracheal suction is in contrast with earlier studies that suggested a more comprehensive transformation of NICU therapies with the introduction of the new NRP guidelines \\cite{Mousavi2011ASR}. Correspondingly, our findings run counter to the premise of a systemic transformation in NICU practice as a result of the policy change, instead suggesting a more targeted impact on specific interventions.\n\nGenerally, our research design poses certain limitations. First, our single-center study may constrain the generalizability of our findings, essentially limiting the representation of other diverse settings. Also, our retrospective design inherently restricts the conclusions drawn to associations rather than direct causality. Our focus on immediate neonatal outcomes also precludes an examination of longer-term outcomes, which might present a more complete picture of the policy implications.\n\nNevertheless, a crucial takeaway from our analysis is the absence of significant changes in neonatal outcomes following the policy change. This suggests that efficient resource utilization can be balanced with high standards of newborn health outcomes, a finding in line with earlier studies \\cite{Wiswell2000DeliveryRM}. Thus, our study reiterates and validates the evidence-based course that neonatal care appears to be steering towards, where judicious use of resources is concurrent with high standards of care. \n\nIn summation, our study contributes valuable insights on the impact of the revised NRP guidelines on NICU therapies and neonatal outcomes. The noticeable decrease in endotracheal suction implies a successful assimilation of the guidelines into clinical practice. However, our findings accentuate the importance of continual surveillance and research into the comprehensive effects of the NRP 2015 guidelines. Future research should explore multicenter investigations and incorporate longer-term outcome indicators, such as those suggested in the Lund2001NeonatalSC and Ghetti2019LongitudinalSO studies, to provide a more holistic understanding of the effects of such guidelines. Identifying practices that combine optimal neonatal outcomes with efficient resource utilization would also be a worthy consideration for future studies, potentially revolutionizing neonatal care.\n```\n",
