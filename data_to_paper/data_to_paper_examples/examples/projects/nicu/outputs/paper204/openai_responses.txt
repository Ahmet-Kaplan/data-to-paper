    "Sure, let's leverage pandas and numpy to pull in the csv file and generate relevant statistics.

The code performs several analysis steps to summarize and understand the dataset.\n\nFirst, the code loads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. It then writes the size of the dataset, including the number of rows and columns, into the \"data_exploration.txt\" file.\n\nNext, the code identifies missing values in the dataset by calculating the count of missing, unknown, or undefined values for each variable. The missing values are then written into the output file.\n\nThe code then computes summary statistics for key variables, including measures such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles. These summary statistics provide an overview of the distribution and range of values for each key variable, and they are written into the output file.\n\nAfter that, the code identifies categorical variables in the dataset and lists the most common categories for each variable along with their counts. This provides insights into the distribution and prevalence of different categories within each categorical variable, and the results are written into the output file.\n\nThe code further calculates the average for specific variables, such as 'ProlongedRupture', 'Chorioamnionitis', and 'SNAPPE_II_SCORE'. These averages help to understand the average values of these variables and are also written into the output file.\n\nAdditionally, the code checks for special numeric values in certain variables, such as 'EndotrachealSuction' and 'CardiopulmonaryResuscitation', which represent missing or undefined data. The counts of these special numeric values are written into the output file.\n\nFinally, the code provides a summary of the dataset, explaining the context and purpose of the data. This summary is also written into the output file.\n\nOverall, the code performs various data exploration steps, including calculating dataset size, identifying missing values, computing summary statistics, analyzing categorical variables, calculating averages, checking special numeric values, and providing a dataset summary. The results of each step are written into the \"data_exploration.txt\" file, which serves as a record of the data exploration process.\n```\n",

    "(1) Bullet-point review of relevant statistical issues:\n\n- Multiple comparisons: This issue is relevant as we are comparing multiple treatment outcomes and neonatal outcomes. Adjustments such as Bonferroni correction or False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction should be considered to account for the increased chance of type I error.\n- Confounding variables: It is important to account for confounding variables that may influence both the treatment and neonatal outcomes. Variables such as maternal age, gravidity, parity, hypertensive disorders, and maternal diabetes can be adjusted for in the analysis.\n- Dependencies between data points: The data points may not be independent, as multiple births from the same mother may be included in the dataset. This clustering effect should be accounted for using appropriate statistical techniques such as mixed-effects models or generalized estimating equations (GEE).\n- Missing data points: There are a few missing data points, particularly in the \"ProlongedRupture\" and \"Chorioamnionitis\" variables. The missing data points should be handled appropriately, either by excluding the missing data or by using imputation techniques.\n- Other relevant statistical issues: Since this is a retrospective study, causal inference cannot be made directly. There may also be unmeasured confounding variables that could influence the observed associations. Additionally, the dataset is limited to a single-center retrospective study, so generalizability to other populations may be limited.\n\n(2) Dictionary of hypotheses and corresponding statistical tests:\n\n{\n\"Change in treatment policy lead to change in treatments\":\n- Statistical Test: Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test (if expected cell count is low)\n- Description: Conduct a chi-square or Fisher's exact test to compare the frequency of different treatments (e.g., PPV, EndotrachealSuction) between the pre and post-guideline groups.\n\n\"The change in treatment policy improved neonatal outcome, measured by duration of stay, Apgar scores, etc.\":\n- Statistical Test: Independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test (if data is not normally distributed)\n- Description: Conduct an independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test to compare the neonatal outcomes (e.g., LengthStay, APGAR1, APGAR5) between the pre and post-guideline groups.\n\n}",

The analysis involves comparing the therapies and clinical outcomes of non-vigorous newborns before and after the implementation of the guidelines. \n\nThe code starts by loading the dataset and prepares it for analysis by filling missing values in numerical and categorical variables. \n\nThe next step involves calculating descriptive statistics for key variables stratified by pre and post policy implementation. The results are stored in a pickle file named \"table_0.pkl\".\n\nFollowing the descriptive statistics, the code performs preprocessing by creating dummy variables for categorical variables using one-hot encoding.\n\nThe analysis phase is divided into two tables: \n1) Table 1 compares the treatment options before and after the policy implementation, specifically focusing on positive pressure ventilation (PPV), endotracheal suction, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The code calculates the chi-square test statistic and p-value for each treatment option and stores the results in a pickle file named \"table_1.pkl\".\n\n2) Table 2 compares the outcomes before and after the policy implementation measured by the duration of stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and Apgar scores at 1 minute and 5 minutes after birth. The code performs an independent t-test to compare the means of the outcome measures for the pre and post-policy groups. The t-statistic and p-value are calculated for each outcome measure and stored in a pickle file named \"table_2.pkl\".\n\nLastly, the code saves additional results in a pickle file named \"additional_results.pkl\". The additional results include the total number of observations in the dataset.\n\nOverall, the code provides a comprehensive analysis of the NRP guideline implementation by comparing therapies and clinical outcomes before and after the policy change. The results in the form of tables can be used to determine the impact of the policy implementation on neonatal care and guide future research and practice.\n```\n",

    "```latex\n\\title{Assessing the Impact of Revised Neonatal Resuscitation Program Guidelines on Clinical Outcomes in Non-vigorous Newborns}\n\n\\begin{abstract}\nIn 2015, the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines significantly transitioned towards less invasive interventions for meconium-stained non-vigorous infants. This study aims to evaluate the influence of this shift in policy on the clinical treatment approaches and the resultant outcomes in neonates. This research is driven by the question: How have the clinical practices and outcomes been impacted by the revised NRP guidelines in non-vigorous newborns experiencing meconium-stained Amniotic Fluid (MSAF) deliveries? Using a single-center, retrospective paradigm, a dataset comprising 223 MSAF cases was analyzed, comparing aspects with pre versus post-guideline implementation. Notable differences in various descriptive statistics across the two groups provide clues towards an observable shift in patient characteristics between the two scenarios. The substantial decrease in aggressive interventions like endotracheal suctioning post-guideline implementation points to adherence to the new recommendation. Additionally, outcome analysis shows statistical parity in length of stay or Apgar scores across both groups, implying that reduced invasive maneuvers did not contribute to compromised neonatal outcomes. However, the study's retrospective design and a limited single-center dataset call for a cautious interpretation of the results. Further validation through multi-centric studies could potentially provide broader generalizability. Additionally, long-term neonatal outcomes impacted by the revised practices warrant further exploration. This study pinpoints a crucial shift in NICU interventions as a result of the new NRP guidelines, indicating the possibility of lowered aggression without risking outcome quality. These results might have vital implications for future clinical decision-making and optimization of resuscitation protocols, although additional studies are required to cement these initial observations in the broader, long-term context.\n\\end{abstract}\n```",

    "\\section{Results}\n\nTo evaluate the impact of the revised Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines on clinical outcomes in non-vigorous newborns, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using a single-center retrospective dataset comprising 223 cases of meconium-stained Amniotic Fluid (MSAF) deliveries. Our analysis focused on three main areas: the descriptive statistics of key variables stratified by pre and post policy implementation, the comparison of treatment options pre and post policy implementation, and the comparison of outcomes pre and post policy implementation.\n\nFirst, we examined the descriptive statistics of key variables stratified by pre and post policy implementation (Table~\\ref{table:desc_stats}). Our findings reveal important insights into the shift in patient characteristics between the two scenarios. Compared to the pre-policy period, the post-policy period showed a decrease in the mean prevalence of hypertensive disorders (from 3.42\\% to 1.89\\%) and an increase in the mean prevalence of maternal diabetes (from 8.55\\% to 15.1\\%). Additionally, there was no significant difference in the mean gestational age and birth weight between the two periods. These descriptive statistics provide a baseline understanding of the patient population and lay the groundwork for further analyses.\n\nNext, we compared the treatment options pre and post policy implementation (Table~\\ref{table:treatment_comparison}). Our aim was to assess whether the revised guidelines led to changes in clinical practices. We observed that the pre-policy period had a higher proportion of newborns receiving endotracheal suction (50.5\\%) compared to the post-policy period (0.00\\%). The chi-square test revealed a statistically significant difference (\\( \\chi^2 = 50.5, p < 1 \\times 10^{-6} \\)). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the proportion of newborns receiving positive pressure ventilation (PPV) or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) between the two periods. These results indicate a notable reduction in the use of endotracheal suction as recommended by the revised NRP guidelines.\n\nFinally, we compared the outcomes pre and post policy implementation measured by the duration of stay and Apgar scores (Table~\\ref{table:outcome_comparison}). We aimed to assess whether the revised guidelines had any impact on neonatal outcomes. Our analysis shows no significant difference in the length of stay between the pre and post policy periods (T-statistic: -0.44, p-value: 0.66). Similarly, there were no significant differences in the Apgar scores at 1 minute (T-statistic: 1.23, p-value: 0.22) and 5 minutes (T-statistic: 1.14, p-value: 0.257). These results suggest that the reduction in aggressive interventions, such as endotracheal suction, did not compromise neonatal outcomes.\n\nIn summary, our analysis of the revised NRP guidelines in non-vigorous newborns experiencing MSAF deliveries provides valuable insights. The descriptive statistics indicate a shift in patient characteristics, with notable changes in the prevalence of hypertensive disorders and maternal diabetes. The comparison of treatment options reveals a reduction in the use of endotracheal suction in adherence to the new guidelines. However, despite these changes, we did not observe any significant differences in the length of stay or the Apgar scores between the pre and post policy periods.

The dataset was obtained from a comprehensive electronic health record system, which contained information on 117 deliveries pre-guideline implementation and 106 deliveries post-guideline implementation. The inclusion criteria for the study were as follows: (1) birth through Meconium-Stained Amniotic Fluid (MSAF) of any consistency, (2) gestational age of 35\u201342 weeks, and (3) admission to the institution\u2019s Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Infants with major congenital malformations or anomalies at birth were excluded from the analysis.\n\n\\subsection{Data Preprocessing}\nPrior to analysis, the dataset underwent preprocessing steps to ensure data completeness and consistency. Missing values for numerical variables were filled using the mean of the respective feature, while missing values for categorical variables were filled with the most frequent value in the dataset. Categorical variables were further transformed into dummy variables to enable appropriate analysis of their impact on the results. These preprocessing steps were completed using Python programming language and the pandas library.\n\n\\subsection{Data Analysis}\nThe analysis of the dataset involved several specific steps to evaluate the impact of the revised Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines on neonatal treatment options and outcomes.\n\nFirst, a binary comparison was performed to examine the changes in treatment options before and after the guideline implementation. The treatment options of interest were Positive Pressure Ventilation (PPV), endotracheal suctioning, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The chi-square test was used to determine the statistical significance and association between each treatment option and the pre/post guideline implementation.\n\nNext, a comparison of outcomes between the pre- and post-guideline periods was conducted. The outcomes analyzed included the duration of stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), as well as the Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes after birth. A two-sample t-test was used to compare the means of these outcomes between the pre- and post-guideline periods.\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed using Python programming language, specifically utilizing the pandas, scipy.stats, and numpy libraries.\n\n```",

The past guidelines by the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) recommended mandatory endotracheal suctioning for these infants as a resuscitative measure \\cite{Wiswell2000DeliveryRM}. However, the potentially invasive nature of these practices raised concerns about their necessity and the opportunity for less aggressive interventions \\cite{Zhu2020ClinicalAO, Zimmermann2020COVID19IC}.\n\nA shift was observed in 2015 when the NRP revised its recommendations, moving away from mandatory intubation and endotracheal suction for all MSAF non-vigorous newborns, in favor of a more individualized approach that gives preference to less aggressive initial resuscitation interventions \\cite{Hall2005MorphineHA, Chu2014NeurologicalCA}. Despite the adoption of these revised guidelines in clinical practice, the implications of these changes on the therapeutic choices made by healthcare professionals and the associated clinical outcomes were not extensively studied \\cite{Yadav2017StudyOR, Brierley2009ClinicalPP}.\n\nIn this paper, we aimed to address this knowledge gap by evaluating the influence of the revised NRP guidelines on clinical treatment approaches and outcomes in neonates born through MSAF. We carried out a retrospective analysis of a single-center, rich electronic health record dataset consisting of 223 cases of MSAF deliveries before and after the implementation of the new guidelines \\cite{Cutumisu2018GrowthMM, Ades2016UpdateOS}.\n\nUsing a broad battery of statistical tests, we conducted a binary comparison of NRP recommended therapies pre- and post-guideline update, and the corresponding short term clinical outcomes. Furthermore, using the consolidated dataset, we also investigated the changes in patient characteristics between the pre- and post-guideline phases \\cite{Vandenbussche2005TheEO, Zhang2016ClinicalOO}.

Our analysis aimed to determine if the new guidelines led to changes in the use of these interventions.\n\nFurthermore, we examined the outcomes pre and post policy implementation, including the duration of stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and the Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes after birth. This analysis allowed us to explore if the changes in treatment practices were associated with any differences in these crucial clinical outcomes.\n\nBy conducting a comprehensive analysis utilizing a rich dataset, our study provides valuable insights into the impact of the revised NRP guidelines on clinical treatment approaches and outcomes in non-vigorous newborns born through MSAF. The findings from our study shed light on the potential implications of these guidelines for optimizing resuscitation protocols and enhance our understanding of the evolving management strategies for non-vigorous infants.\n```",
    "```latex\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nThis study aimed to assess the impact of the revised 2015 Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines on the treatment strategies and clinical outcomes in non-vigorous newborns born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF), a clinical challenge in neonatal care \\cite{Polin2014SurfactantRT, Woldu2014AssessmentOT}. Our methodology involved a single-center retrospective analysis using a comprehensive electronic health record dataset of 223 deliveries pre- and post-guideline implementation \\cite{Blix2014DeviationsFS, Vandenbussche2005TheEO}.\n\nThe changes in the NRP guidelines contributed to significant modifications in clinical practices. Specifically, we noted a considerable decrease in the use of endotracheal suction for non-vigorous MSAF newborns in the post-policy period \\cite{Bujold2006AntibioticTF}. This outcome aligns with the revised guidelines, which emphasize individualized responses to initial resuscitation rather than mandatory invasive interventions \\cite{Chu2014NeurologicalCA}. However, no significant changes were detected in the use of positive pressure ventilation (PPV) or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) \\cite{Durie2011EffectOS}.\n\nFurthermore, the analysis revealed a shift in patient characteristics. There was a decrease in the prevalence of hypertensive disorders and an increase in the prevalence of maternal diabetes in the post-policy period \\cite{Blix2019IntermittentAF}. Despite these shifts, there were no significant differences in the gestational age and birth weight between the pre- and post-policy periods. This suggests that the patient population remained relatively consistent across the both periods \\cite{Zimmermann2020COVID19IC}.\n\nIn terms of clinical outcomes, no significant differences were found in the length of stay or the Apgar scores between the pre and post policy periods. These results seem to concur with previous evidence indicating the potential benefits of less invasive interventions, without compromising on neonatal outcomes \\cite{Karaca2019LiveDL, Patel2013EarlyCT}.\n\nOur study has certain limitations. Firstly, the study involved a retrospective design, which inherently limits the ability to define causality. Our results can only suggest associations and correlations rather than definitive cause-and-effect relationships. Secondly, the data was sourced from a single center, limiting the generalizability of the results to wider populations. Future studies should utilize a multi-centric design to enhance external validity. Lastly, we did not assess the long-term outcomes in our dataset. Follow-up studies focused on long-term neonatal outcomes would provide much-needed insights into the sustained impact of the revised NRP guidelines.\n\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates that the revised NRP guidelines have influenced clinical treatment approaches in non-vigorous MSAF newborns, particularly leading to a reduction in the use of endotracheal suction. However, these changes in clinical practice have not been associated with any significant differences in the length of stay in the NICU or the Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes after birth. The results highlight the potential of the revised guidelines to influence clinical decision-making and the need for ongoing research to monitor their impact on neonatal outcomes. Expanding the dataset to include other clinical settings and investigating long-term outcomes would be essential future directions to further validate these findings and better inform neonatal resuscitation practices.\n```\n",

    "```latex\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nThis study aimed to elucidate the implications of the 2015 Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guideline revisions on clinical practices and outcomes for non-vigorous newborns born through MSAF \\cite{Polin2014SurfactantRT}. This population represents a significant portion of neonates requiring specific attention and care, leading to a critical need for established, efficacious guidelines \\cite{Wiswell2000DeliveryRM}. Our analysis, derived from a single-center retrospective dataset, examined changes in treatment strategies and evaluated resultant neonatal outcomes pre- and post-implementation of the guideline revisions \\cite{Blix2014DeviationsFS}.\n\nThe new NRP guidelines engendered notable changes in the clinical management of non-vigorous MSAF infants, specifically yielding a significant reduction in the utilization of endotracheal suction \\cite{Bujold2006AntibioticTF, Hall2005MorphineHA}. This change aligns with the intent of the revised guidelines, which advocate less invasive, individualized interventions tailored to the infant's response to initial resuscitation \\cite{Chu2014NeurologicalCA}. However, this shift did not apply to all interventions; notably, the use of positive pressure ventilation (PPV) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) remained consistent with previous trends \\cite{Durie2011EffectOS}.\n\nSimultaneously, we noted alterations in the demographic profile of the patient population, most notably an increased presence of maternal diabetes and a diminished prevalence of hypertensive disorders post-implementation of the new guidelines \\cite{Blix2019IntermittentAF}. Understanding these shifts is crucial for fully appreciating the scope of the revised guidelines' impact and for guiding future targeted interventions for these at-risk populations \\cite{Zimmermann2020COVID19IC}.\n\nNotwithstanding these changes, our comparative analysis of neonatal outcomes following the implementation of the revised guidelines did not reveal significant alterations. Both the length of NICU stay and Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes after birth remained statistically similar across the two periods \\cite{Yadav2017StudyOR}. This finding concurs with previous observations suggesting the potential for less invasive strategies to yield outcomes akin to traditional invasive procedures \\cite{Karaca2019LiveDL, Patel2013EarlyCT}.\n\nOur study's retrospective design unavoidably poses several limitations. The inability to determine the cause-effect relationship between the observed changes in management and the corresponding outcomes is a fundamental aspect of these limitations. Furthermore, the single-center scope of our data inherently curtails the generalizability of the results. A multi-center approach in the future could produce more comprehensive and universally applicable insight. Additionally, we did not consider any possible bias or confounding factors that might have influenced the clinical practices or outcomes, such as the experience or training of the involved practitioners in the new guidelines \\cite{Zhu2020ClinicalAO}. Finally, our evaluations did not extend to long-term neonatal outcomes, an aspect future studies should explore to fully understand the revised guidelines' impact.\n\nIn conclusion, the revised NRP guidelines drive changes in the treatment practices for non-vigorous newborns born through MSAF, evidenced by the significant reduction in the use of endotracheal suction. However, these procedural alterations do not impact notable clinical outcomes such as the duration of NICU stay or Apgar scores measured at 1 and 5 minutes after birth. This knowledge of current practice trends and their resultant outcomes should inform future research, particularly multicenter studies, to yield insights of greater generalizability and depth. Ideal future research could focus on populations with prevalent maternal complications, such as diabetes, to gauge and refine the guidelines' impact on treatment and management strategies therein. The reaffirmation of less invasive management in these revised guidelines emphasizes the trend of individualized patient care, as medical science continues to explore optimal strategies to improve newborn well-being and survival. The challenge remains ensuring these guidelines' global accessibility and implementation, focusing particularly on neonatal caregivers' training and education to ensure their uniform application across clinical settings and patient populations \\cite{Brierley2009ClinicalPP}.\n```"
