    "(1) Relevant Statistical Issues Review:\n- Multiple comparisons: Multiple comparisons may be relevant if we plan to perform multiple statistical tests on the same dataset. We need to account for the possibility of inflated Type I error rate and consider methods such as Bonferroni correction or False Discovery Rate (FDR) adjustment.\n- Confounding variables: Confounding variables are variables that are associated with both the predictor and the outcome variable and can influence the observed relationship. In our case, we have potential confounding variables such as age, sex, height, and weight. We should adjust for these variables to minimize their potential confounding effects.\n- Dependencies between data points: We need to consider if there are any dependencies between the data points. If there are dependencies, such as repeated measures or clustered data, we should account for them using appropriate statistical methods (e.g., mixed-effects models or generalized estimating equations).\n- Missing data points: It is important to assess if there are any missing data points in our dataset. If there are missing data points, we need to consider how to handle them, such as imputation or exclusion of missing data.\n- Other relevant statistical issues: Other relevant statistical issues may include model selection, model validation, and checking for assumptions (e.g., linearity, normality, homoscedasticity) for the chosen statistical tests.\n\n(2) Hypothesis Testing Plan:\nCreate a Python dict mapping each hypothesis to the most suitable statistical test and taking into account the relevant statistical issues outlined above.\n\n```python\nhypothesis_testing_plan = {\n    \"The machine-learning model will have a significantly better predictive power than the formula-based model\":\n    \"Paired t-test on the squared residuals of the machine-learning model and the formula-based model, accounting for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction\",\n}\n```\nNote: Since we have only one hypothesis, we do not need to consider multiple comparisons.

The dataset includes features extracted from patient electronic health records, such as patient sex, age, height, weight, and the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) determined by chest X-ray.\n\nThe code first computes descriptive statistics of the OTTD stratified by sex and saves the results in a file called \"table_0.pkl\". This provides insights into the average and standard deviation of the OTTD for female and male patients.\n\nNext, the code prepares the dataset for analysis by creating an additional column called \"predicted_formula\", which represents the OTTD calculated using a formula-based model. This column is based on the patient's height using a simple formula. \n\nThe code then splits the dataset into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training a machine-learning model and 20% for testing the model's predictive performance. The machine-learning model used is a Random Forest Regressor.\n\nAfter training the model, it makes predictions on the testing set. The predicted OTTD values are stored in the \"predicted_ML\" column. The code also calculates the squared residuals for both the machine-learning model (stored in the \"residuals_ML\" column) and the formula-based model (stored in the \"residuals_formula\" column).\n\nTo compare the predictive performance of the machine-learning model with the formula-based model, the code computes the mean and standard deviation of the predicted OTTD values and squared residuals for both models. These results are saved in a file called \"table_1.pkl\".\n\nFinally, the code performs a hypothesis test (t-test) to determine if the machine-learning model has a significantly better predictive performance than the formula-based model. If the p-value of the test is less than 0.05, indicating statistical significance, the code saves additional results including the total number of observations, the t-statistic, and the p-value in a file called \"additional_results.pkl\".\n\nThe \"additional_results.pkl\" file provides information on the statistical comparison between the machine-learning model and the formula-based model, indicating whether the machine-learning model outperforms the formula-based model in predicting the optimal tracheal tube depth for pediatric patients on mechanical ventilation.\n\n```\n",

To address this gap, we present a machine learning approach for predicting OTTD in pediatric patients.

The mean predicted OTTD by the machine learning model was 10.2 cm, compared to 11.6 cm by the formula-based model. The machine learning model also showed lower squared residuals (1.4 vs 3.42), indicating better accuracy. Importantly, our results highlight the potential of machine learning as a reliable tool for predicting OTTD in pediatric patients, providing a non-invasive and efficient alternative to chest X-rays.

First, to understand the relationship between sex and OTTD, we stratified the dataset by sex and calculated descriptive statistics of OTTD for each group. As shown in Table \\ref{table:OTTD_Stratified_by_Sex}, we observed a mean OTTD of 10.1 cm with a standard deviation of 1.65 cm in female patients, while male patients had a mean OTTD of 10.3 cm with a standard deviation of 1.86 cm. These results indicate that there is little difference in OTTD between female and male pediatric patients.\n\nNext, we compared the predictive performance of our machine learning model with a formula-based model to assess the accuracy of predicting OTTD. The machine learning model, trained on features such as sex, age, height, and weight, outperformed the formula-based model. As shown in Table \\ref{table:Model_Comparison}, the mean predicted OTTD by the machine learning model was 10.2 cm, with a standard deviation of 1.36 cm. In contrast, the formula-based model yielded a mean predicted OTTD of 11.6 cm, with a standard deviation of 1.98 cm. The squared residuals for the machine learning model were lower (mean: 1.4, standard deviation: 2.89) compared to the formula-based model (mean: 3.42, standard deviation: 4.45). These results indicate that our machine learning model provides more accurate predictions of OTTD compared to the formula-based model.\n\nTo assess the statistical significance of the difference in predictive performance between the machine learning model and the formula-based model, we conducted a paired-sample t-test on the squared residuals. The t-statistic was -6.227, with a p-value of $2.901 \\times 10^{-9}$. Based on this analysis, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that our machine learning model has a significantly better predictive performance than the formula-based model.\n\nIn summary, our results demonstrate that our machine learning model can accurately predict the optimal tracheal tube depth in pediatric patients. The model outperforms the traditional formula-based approach and provides a non-invasive alternative to chest X-rays. By accurately determining the tracheal tube depth, our model has the potential to enhance patient safety during mechanical ventilation.",
    "```latex\n\\section{Results}\n\nFirst, to understand the distribution of Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (OTTD), we conducted a descriptive analysis stratified by the patient's sex (see Table~\\ref{table:OTTD_Stratified_by_Sex}). The average OTTD in male patients was 10.3 cm (sd=1.86), slightly larger than that of female patients, who had an average OTTD of 10.1 cm (sd=1.65). The difference in averages was negligible, indicating little variation in OTTD by sex in pediatric patients aged 0 to 7 years old.\n\nNext, we wished to explore the performance of a machine learning model compared to the formula-based model in predicting OTTD. As explained in Table~\\ref{table:Model_Comparison}, both models were trained on the training set and tested on a separate validation set. The results were promising for the machine learning model. The mean predicted OTTD by the machine learning model was 10.2 cm (sd=1.36), closer to the mean OTTD than the formula-based model's mean prediction of 11.6 cm (sd=1.98). In addition, the mean squared residual of the predicted OTTD by the machine learning model was 1.4 compared to 3.42 of the formula-based model, indicating a higher predictive accuracy of the machine learning model.\n\nFinally, we conducted a paired t-test to assess whether the difference in predictive performance between the machine learning and the formula-based model was statistically significant. The resulting T statistic was -6.227 with a very low p-value ($p<2.901e-09$). The negative T statistic implies that our machine learning model has significantly smaller residuals, and hence higher accuracy, than the formula-based model.\n\nTaken together, these results suggest that the accuracy of our machine learning model, in predicting OTTD, is significantly higher than the traditionally used formula-based model.\n```\n",
