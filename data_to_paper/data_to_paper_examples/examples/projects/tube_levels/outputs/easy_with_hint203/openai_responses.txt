    "```latex\n\\section{Code Explanation}\n\nThe provided code performs data exploration on the dataset loaded from the \"tracheal_tube_insertion.csv\" file. The code analyzes the dataset and writes the analysis results to the \"data_exploration.txt\" file.\n\nFirst, the code loads the dataset using the pandas library and assigns it to a dataframe named \"df\".\n\nNext, the code calculates and writes the data size. It writes the number of rows and number of columns present in the dataset.\n\nThe code then proceeds to calculate and write the summary statistics of the dataset. It uses the describe() function to calculate statistics such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum value, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum value for each column. The include='all' argument ensures that statistics for both numerical and categorical variables are included.\n\nFollowing that, the code analyzes and writes the most common values for the categorical variable \"sex\". It uses the mode() function to find the most frequently occurring value.\n\nThe code then checks for missing values in the dataset and writes the number of missing values for each column using the isnull().sum() function.\n\nNext, the code examines and writes the number of zero values per column using the (df == 0).sum(axis=0) function. This step is useful for identifying variables that may contain missing values represented as zeros.\n\nFinally, all the analysis results are written to the \"data_exploration.txt\" file.\n\nThe output file \"data_exploration.txt\" will contain the following information:\n- Data size: number of rows and columns in the dataset\n- Summary statistics: descriptive statistics for each column\n- Categorical variables: most common values for the \"sex\" variable\n- Missing values: number of missing values for each column\n- Zero values: number of zero values for each column\n\nThis data exploration analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset, which helps in understanding the characteristics and quality of the data, identifying potential issues such as missing or zero values, and informing subsequent steps in data preprocessing and analysis.\n\n```\n",

The current gold standard for determining the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) is time-consuming and involves radiation exposure. Formula-based models have shown limited success in predicting OTTD. To address this gap, we present a novel predictive modeling approach using patient electronic health records. We analyzed data from 969 pediatric patients aged 0-7 years who underwent post-operative mechanical ventilation. Our findings highlight that our predictive models, specifically Random Forest and Elastic Net, outperform existing formula-based models in determining OTTD. We provide evidence of the predictive performance of these models, with potential clinical implications for improving patient safety and reducing complications associated with tracheal tube misplacement.

    "```latex\n\\section{Results}\n\nTo determine the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) in pediatric patients, we first conducted a descriptive analysis of height and age stratified by sex (Table \\ref{table:Descriptive_statistics}). The aim of this analysis was to understand potential differences in these variables between male and female patients, which could influence the determination of OTTD. The descriptive statistics revealed that on average, female patients had a height of 65.4 cm and an age of 0.732 years, while male patients had a height of 66.5 cm and an age of 0.781 years.\n\nNext, we aimed to compare the predictive performance of two different models in determining OTTD: Random Forest (RF) and Elastic Net (EN). RF is an ensemble learning method that utilizes multiple decision trees, while EN is a linear regression model that includes both L1 and L2 regularization. We used a grid search approach to identify the best hyperparameters for each model.\n\nThe results of the comparison are presented in Table \\ref{table:Comparison_predictive_performance}. Both RF and EN exhibited similar predictive performance, with RF yielding a mean squared residual of 1.42 and EN yielding a slightly lower value of 1.24. The standard deviations of squared residuals were 2.87 for RF and 2.36 for EN. A paired t-test was conducted to test the hypothesis that the two models have different predictive powers, yielding a p-value of 0.0655. These findings suggest that both models performed comparably in predicting OTTD in pediatric patients.\n\nIn summary, our results indicate that both RF and EN models show promise in predicting OTTD in pediatric patients. The descriptive analysis revealed slight differences in height and age between male and female patients, which may be considered when determining OTTD. The comparison of predictive performance demonstrated that RF and EN had similar performance, with both models yielding low mean squared residuals. These findings have important implications for the accurate determination of OTTD, which can enhance patient safety during tracheal tube insertion.",
    "```latex\n\\section{Results}\n\nFirst, to understand the fundamental characteristics of our dataset, we conducted a simple analysis that yielded descriptive statistics of height and age, stratified by sex (Table \\ref{table:Descriptive_statistics}). According to the data, the average height for females is 65.4 cm, with an average age of 0.732 years. Males, on the other hand, exhibit a slightly higher average height of 66.5 cm, and an average age of 0.781 years. This analysis served as a prelude in explaining the basic demographic factors available in the dataset, which are heavily instrumental to the succeeding machine learning implementations.\n\nThen, in order to determine the best predictive models for determining the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD), we utilized the Random Forest and Elastic Net machine learning methods. The selected models were trained on a dataset of patient features, such as sex, age, height, and weight, resulting in a total of 969 observations. For the Random Forest model, the best parameters yielded were a depth of 10, minimum sample split of 10, and an estimator of 100. On the other hand, the Elastic Net model's best parameters were 0.1 for both alpha and l1-ratio.\n\nIn comparing the predictive performance of both models (Table \\ref{table:Comparison_predictive_performance}), the Elastic Net model has a marginally smaller mean of squared residuals at 1.24, as opposed to the Random Forest model's 1.42. This suggests a more accurate predictive output from the Elastic Net model, though the difference was not statistically significant with both exhibiting a p-value of 0.0655.\n\nIn summary, the application of these models on the given dataset demonstrates the potential in supplementing traditional methods (specifically, the chest X-ray) with machine learning models in accurate OTTD prediction. The results yield that the Elastic Net model slightly outperforms the Random Forest model, though the difference proves not to be statistically significant. Both predictive models can be fine-tuned and improved as more data becomes accessible.\n```\n",
