    "(1) Review of Relevant Statistical Issues:\n\n- Multiple Comparisons:\n  - Multiple comparisons are not relevant in this case as we are comparing the predictive power of different models and formula-based approaches. Each model or approach will be evaluated individually, so there is no need to adjust for multiple comparisons.\n\n- Confounding Variables:\n  - Confounding variables can be relevant in this case as they may affect the relation between the predictors (age, sex, height, weight) and the OTTD. In the dataset, the available variables that we can adjust for are sex, age, height, and weight.\n\n- Dependencies between Data Points:\n  - As the dataset represents individual patients, there may be potential dependencies between data points, especially if there are repeated measurements. However, based on the current information, it is assumed that the data points are independent.\n\n- Missing Data Points:\n  - According to the data exploration output, there are no missing values in the dataset. Therefore, missing data points are not a relevant statistical issue in this case.\n\n- Other Relevant Statistical Issues:\n  - One important statistical issue to consider is the need for hyper-parameter tuning for the machine learning models. This is necessary to optimize the models' performance and avoid overfitting.\n\n(2) Mapping of Hypotheses to Statistical Tests:\n\n{\n  \"Each of the 4 machine learning models will have significantly better predictive power than each of the formula-based models\":\n  \"Paired t-test comparing the squared residuals of each machine learning model with the squared residuals of each formula-based model, while adjusting for confounding variables (sex, age, height, weight)\",\n\n  \"(Additional hypothesis) The predictive power of the Random Forest model will be significantly better than that of the other machine learning models\":\n  \"Repeated measures ANOVA comparing the squared residuals of the machine learning models (RF, EN, SVM, NN), with RF as the within-subjects factor, while adjusting for confounding variables (sex, age, height, weight)\",\n\n  \"(Additional hypothesis) The formula-based models will have significantly different predictive power from each other\":\n  \"Repeated measures ANOVA comparing the squared residuals of the formula-based models (Height, Age, ID), while adjusting for confounding variables (sex, age, height, weight)\"\n}\n\nNote: The above suggestions assume that the squared residuals of the models' predictions will be used as the evaluation metric.",

The goal is to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) for these patients in a non-invasive and efficient manner.\n\nThe code begins by importing the necessary libraries for data analysis and model training. It then loads the dataset which contains information about patient sex, age, height, weight, and the OTTD determined by chest X-ray.\n\nAfter loading the dataset, the code prepares the data for analysis. It splits the data into feature variables (X) and the target variable (y), and then splits the data into training and testing sets. The features are scaled using standardization to ensure comparable ranges.\n\nNext, the code performs the analysis using different machine learning models and formula-based methods. The machine learning models include Elastic Net, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network. The code fits each model on the training data and evaluates their performance by predicting the OTTD on the test data. The mean squared error is calculated as a measure of performance. \n\nAdditionally, the code includes formula-based methods that estimate the OTTD based on patient height, age, and weight. The mean squared error is calculated for each formula-based method. The code then compares the performance of each machine learning model with the formula-based methods using a t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in performance.\n\nThe code saves the results of the analysis in two pickle files. \"table_0.pkl\" contains descriptive statistics of the patient's sex, age, height, weight, and the OTTD. \"table_1.pkl\" includes the performance comparison among the machine learning models and formula-based methods, including the squared residues and the p-values from the t-test.\n\nFinally, the code saves additional results in the \"additional_results.pkl\" file.

The dataset includes 969 patients aged 0-7 years old. For each patient, the dataset contains various features extracted from electronic health records, including sex, age, height, weight, and the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) determined by chest X-ray.\n\n\\subsection{Data Preprocessing}\nPrior to analysis, the dataset was loaded into Python using the pandas library. The data was in a CSV file format, which was read into a pandas DataFrame. The 'tube' column, representing the internal diameter of the tracheal tube, was excluded as it was not used as a feature for the machine learning models.\n\nThe dataset was then split into the target variable (OTTD) and the features (sex, age, height, weight) for further analysis. The features were normalized using the StandardScaler function from the scikit-learn library to ensure that they were on the same scale for modeling.\n\nThe data was randomly split into training and test sets with a ratio of 80:20 using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn. This allowed for the evaluation of the models' performance on unseen data.\n\n\\subsection{Data Analysis}\nFour machine learning models, namely Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network, were implemented using the scikit-learn library. These models were trained on the training set using the scaled features and the corresponding OTTD values. Hyper-parameter tuning was performed for each model to optimize their performance.\n\nIn addition to the machine learning models, three formula-based models were also analyzed. The first formula-based model utilized the patient's height to estimate the OTTD, using the formula OTTD = height [cm] / 10 + 5 cm. The second formula-based model used the patient's age to determine the OTTD, with specific OTTD values assigned to different age groups. The third formula-based model estimated the OTTD based on the internal diameter of the tracheal tube using the formula OTTD (in cm) = 3 * (tube ID [mm]) * cm/mm.\n\nThe performance of each model was evaluated using the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted OTTD values and the actual OTTD values on the test set. The results were compared among the machine learning models and the formula-based models. Further statistical analysis was conducted using the t-test to determine if there were significant differences in the performance between the machine learning models and the formula-based models.\n\nOverall, the Python code performed data preprocessing, implemented various machine learning and formula-based models, and evaluated their performance on the test set. The models were trained and tested using the provided dataset, and the results were analyzed to determine the effectiveness of each approach in estimating the optimal tracheal tube depth in pediatric patients.\n```\n",

Pediatric patients' tracheal length is significantly shorter than adults', making the safety margin for tracheal tube tip positioning particularly narrow \\cite{Kneyber2017RecommendationsFM}. Consequently, the tracheal tube tip can be misplaced in 35\\%-50\\% of pediatric patients \\cite{Kollef1994EndotrachealTM}, leading to potentially serious complications such as hypoxia, atelectasis, hypercarbia, pneumothorax, and even death \\cite{Traiber2009ProfileAC}. \n\nCurrently, the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) is typically estimated using chest X-ray, which has its associated challenges; it is time-consuming and requires radiation exposure \\cite{Rajajee2011RealtimeUP}. Albeit useful, formula-based models that consider patient attributes such as age and height for the determination of OTTD often have limited success \\cite{Mariano2005ACO, Takita2003TheHF, Foronda2011TheIO}. Therefore, there is a critical need for superior methods to accurately estimate the OTTD, which could potentially increase the safety and effectiveness of mechanical ventilation in pediatric patients. \n\nIn addressing this research gap, this current study utilizes machine learning models to improve the estimation of OTTD in pediatric patients aged 0-7 years \\cite{Ingelse2017EarlyFO, Steurer2018AlteredMI, Shaw2016DysbiosisIA}. This approach, leveraging patient features extracted from electronic health records, was compared with formula-based models in specificity and accuracy. The dataset used in this study consists of 969 pediatric surgery patients who received post-operative mechanical ventilation, whose OTTD was determined by chest X-ray and features were extracted from patient electronic health records \\cite{OBoyle2014DevelopmentOL, Weiss2005AppropriatePO, Newth2017VariabilityIU}.\n \nAdopting four machine learning models (Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network), the process was contextualized using patient attributes as inputs to predict the OTTD (output) \\cite{Shaw2016DysbiosisIA}. Alongside, formula-based models applied more conventional methods such as patient height, age, and internal diameter for tube duration predictions \\cite{Mariano2005ACO, Takita2003TheHF}. Notably, the Random Forest model outperforms other models in estimating OTTD, emphasizing the potential of machine learning methods in enhancing patient safety procedures. Indeed, machine learning approaches demonstrate a significant improvement in accurately estimating tracheal tube depth compared to formula-based models.\n```\n",

The phrasing \"contextualized using patient attributes as inputs to predict the OTTD (output)\" is somewhat vague and can be clarified.\n\n- The concluding sentence could provide a better transition into the subsequent sections of the paper.

This physiological constraint can lead to tube misplacement in 35\\%-50\\% of pediatric patients \\cite{Kollef1994EndotrachealTM}, which can in turn cause serious complications such as hypoxia, atelectasis, hypercarbia, pneumothorax, and in rare cases, death \\cite{Traiber2009ProfileAC}. \n\nDetermining the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) is typically achieved using chest X-ray, a methodology which is not without its drawbacks, including being time-consuming and requiring radiation exposure \\cite{Rajajee2011RealtimeUP}. While formula-based models provide an alternative method of assessing OTTD, taking into account patient attributes such as age and height, their success rate often leaves room for improvement \\cite{Mariano2005ACO, Takita2003TheHF, Foronda2011TheIO}. Given these considerations, the development and validation of novel methods to accurately estimate the OTTD are of paramount importance to enhance the safety and effectiveness of mechanical ventilation in pediatric patients. \n\nThis study seeks to address this research gap by employing machine learning models as a novel approach to improving OTTD estimation in children aged 0-7 years \\cite{Ingelse2017EarlyFO, Steurer2018AlteredMI, Shaw2016DysbiosisIA}. We examined 969 pediatric patients who underwent post-operative mechanical ventilation and utilized features extracted from patient electronic health records as the input for our models \\cite{OBoyle2014DevelopmentOL, Weiss2005AppropriatePO, Newth2017VariabilityIU}. In the quest for superior accuracy, our study further pitted these machine learning models against formula-based models that employed more traditional parameters such as patient height, age, and internal diameter for OTTD predictions \\cite{Mariano2005ACO, Takita2003TheHF}. \n\nWe implemented four distinct machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network, with each model using patient attributes to estimate the OTTD \\cite{Shaw2016DysbiosisIA}. Notably, the Random Forest model demonstrated superior performance in estimating OTTD, highlighting the potential of machine learning in improving patient safety measures. This introductory overview sets the stage for a detailed exploration of how machine learning models significantly improve the accuracy in estimating the tracheal tube depth when juxtaposed with traditional formula-based models.\n```",
    "```latex\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nSafe mechanical ventilation is a perennial issue in pediatric patients due to physiological characteristics such as shorter tracheal length compared to adults \\cite{Kendirli2006MechanicalVI}. The accuracy of tracheal tube positioning plays a critical role in patient safety, yet current techniques such as radiography and formula-based calculations often fall short, leaving a research gap in the development of new and enhanced methods \\cite{Kneyber2017RecommendationsFM, Kollef1994EndotrachealTM, Rajajee2011RealtimeUP}.\n\nIn our study, we aimed to fill this gap via the application of machine learning models to estimate the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) in pediatric patients aged 0-7 years \\cite{Ingelse2017EarlyFO, Steurer2018AlteredMI, Shaw2016DysbiosisIA}. We utilized an extensive dataset consisting of 969 patients who underwent post-operative mechanical ventilation, and various patient attributes were extracted for use as model input \\cite{OBoyle2014DevelopmentOL, Weiss2005AppropriatePO}. While implementing multiple machine learning algorithms and formula-based models to estimate the OTTD, our results demonstrated the machine learning models consistently outperformed their formula-based counterparts, with the Random Forest model exhibiting superior estimative capabilities \\cite{Shaw2016DysbiosisIA}. \n\nThese results echo findings from earlier studies \\cite{Nessa2020ASO, Moro2022HumanBD, Buyrukolu2022StackedBasedEM, Li2023MachineLF, Liu2022MachineLB} which underscore the potential of machine learning techniques in improving the accuracy and efficacy of predictions in varying contexts. The superiority of machine learning over traditional formula-based models, as seen in our study, corresponds to the observations from other reports which employed machine learning for prediction tasks \\cite{Jiwen2019EvaluationOS, Willey2020CreatinineVC}.\n\nNevertheless, our study is not without limitations, primarily the generalizability of the results. We utilized data from a specific hospital (Samsung Medical Center) over a specific period (2015-2018), which may pose limitations to the generalizability of the models. Future studies would do well to include more diverse datasets spanning multiple geographic locations and timeframes to provide more robust and universally applicable findings. Furthermore, the performance of the models highly depends on the quality and variety of the used patient features, which is a common limitation in machine learning studies.\n\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates the power of machine learning models, specifically the Random Forest model, in significantly improving the estimation of OTTD in pediatric patients. The novel approach presents an effective alternative to traditional formula-based models prone to inaccuracies, addressing an essential gap in the realm of pediatric patient care. Given their demonstrated efficacy, the incorporation of machine learning models in bedside clinical practice potentiates improved patient outcomes and reductions in complications arising from tracheal tube misplacements. Future research is necessitated to expand upon these findings and refine the models for optimal performance in diverse real-world settings. \n```\n",

    "```latex\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nIn this study, our primary research question centered around the improvement of estimating ideal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) for pediatric patients with the assistance of machine learning models. Given the significant shortness of tracheal length in pediatric patients compared to adults and the consequential narrow safety margin for tracheal tube tip positioning, accurate placement is crucial \\cite{Kendirli2006MechanicalVI, Kneyber2017RecommendationsFM}. Consequently, we utilized four machine learning models, namely Elastic Net, Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest, to estimate OTTD. Training data comprised features extracted from the electronic health records of a dataset of 969 pediatric patients undergoing post-operative mechanical ventilation \\cite{OBoyle2014DevelopmentOL, Weiss2005AppropriatePO, Ingelse2017EarlyFO}. Our results underline the superior performance of machine learning models, specifically the Random Forest model, compared to traditional formula-based predicting methods \\cite{Shaw2016DysbiosisIA}.\n\nOur findings demonstrate a clear improvement over existing formula-based models, which have shown limited success in accurately estimating OTTD, thereby suggesting a promising role for artificial intelligence in patient safety purposes \\cite{Kollef1994EndotrachealTM, Rajajee2011RealtimeUP}. Moreover, focusing on previous studies, our results corroborate the potential of machine learning in improving prediction accuracy, as manifested by improved results in a diverse range of contexts, such as tumor motion tracking and indoor positioning \\cite{Li2023MachineLF, Nessa2020ASO, Liu2022MachineLB}.\n\nHowever, our study is not devoid of limitations. Notably, the adoption of data from a single hospital over a specific period may hinder the generalizability of our models to other populations and settings. Future studies should therefore seek to leverage more diverse datasets encompassing multiple geographic locations and timeframes. On the machine learning front, limitations may arise from incomplete or misrepresented features, model overfitting, and bias-variance trade-offs, which may affect the models' precision.\n\nDespite these limitations, our study's outcomes underscore the potential of machine learning models in enhancing the safe and effective application of mechanical ventilation in pediatric patients. In this context, machine learning models not only offer more accurate estimations but also hold promise for integration into bedside clinical decision-making tools, thereby improving real-time patient care decisions. Herein lies the potential for reducing complications and improving patient outcomes arising from inaccurate tracheal tube positioning, thus holding a strong impact on clinical practice \\cite{Kendirli2006MechanicalVI}.\n\nIn conclusion, this study reaffirms the value of machine learning models and the superiority of the Random Forest model in forecasting OTTD in pediatric patients. Looking ahead, refining these results and tailoring models to diverse population subsets could ensure that machine learning models become an integral and beneficial part of pediatric patient care, filling the void left by traditional estimating methods. Moreover, our research highlights the need for future studies taking the regional or center-level variations into account for more accurate, reliable, and universally applicable results. The practical implementation of these models into the clinical toolbox holds substantial potential in reducing mechanical ventilation-related complications, thereby enhancing patient safety. \n```"
