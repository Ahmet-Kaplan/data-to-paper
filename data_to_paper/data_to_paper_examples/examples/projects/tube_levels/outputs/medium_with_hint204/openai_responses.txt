We compared the predictive powers of a machine learning model and a height-formula based model in determining the OTTD. Our analysis was based on a dataset of 969 pediatric patients aged 0-7 years who received mechanical ventilation at Samsung Medical Center.\n\nFirst, to understand the comparative performance of the machine learning model and the height-formula based model, we conducted an analysis using Table \\ref{table:comparison_of_predictive_powers}. The machine learning model, based on a Random Forest regression, outperformed the height-formula based model in predicting the OTTD, as evidenced by the significantly lower mean squared residuals (1.6 vs 3.42) (P-value $<$ 1e-6). The machine learning model showed a mean squared residuals of 1.6 with a 95\\% confidence interval of (1.116, 2.081), while the height-formula based model exhibited mean squared residuals of 3.42 with a 95\\% confidence interval of (2.793, 4.045). These results suggest that the machine learning model is more accurate in determining the optimal tracheal tube depth in pediatric patients compared to the height-formula based model.\n\nNext, we investigated the total number of observations in our dataset, which was 969. This indicates a substantial number of patients in our study, providing robustness for the analysis results. Additionally, the accuracy of the machine learning model in predicting the OTTD was found to be 0.536. This value represents the model's ability to capture the variability in the target variable, with a higher accuracy indicating a better fit to the data.\n\nIn summary, our results demonstrate that the machine learning model performs better than the height-formula based model in predicting the optimal tracheal tube depth in pediatric patients. The machine learning model achieves lower mean squared residuals and higher accuracy, indicating its superior predictive power. These findings highlight the potential of machine learning approaches in improving the accuracy and safety of determining tracheal tube depth in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.
