    "(1) Relevant Statistical Issues:\n\n- Multiple comparisons: Multiple comparisons might be an issue if we are conducting multiple tests or comparing the performance of multiple models. In our case, since we are comparing the predictive power of only two models (machine-learning and formula-based), multiple comparisons may not be a significant concern.\n\n- Confounding variables: Confounding variables are factors that are associated with both the independent and dependent variables, which can lead to incorrect interpretations of the relationship. In our case, we have a few potential confounding variables like sex, age, height, and weight. It is important to account for these variables when comparing the predictive power of the two models by including them as covariates in the analysis.\n\n- Dependencies between data points: Dependencies between data points may arise if there is clustering or correlation within the data. For example, if multiple measurements were taken from the same patient. It is important to check for dependencies and account for them appropriately in the analysis.\n\n- Missing data points: Missing data points can potentially introduce bias and impact the validity of the analysis. It is important to evaluate the extent of missing data and handle it appropriately, either through imputation or using appropriate statistical methods that can handle missing data.\n\n- Other relevant statistical issues: Other relevant statistical issues may include the choice of evaluation metric for model performance, consideration of model assumptions, and the need for hyper-parameter tuning for the machine-learning model.\n\n(2) Statistical Test for Hypotheses:\n\n{\n  \"The machine-learning model will have a significantly better predictive power than the formula-based model\":\n  \"Perform a paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test on the squared residuals (prediction - target)^2 of the two models while adjusting for confounding variables (sex, age, height, weight) as covariates.\",\n\n  ...\n}\n\nNote: The above is just an example format, and the actual statistical test and adjustments might differ based on the specific requirements of the analysis.",

The aim is to determine the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (OTTD) for these patients using two different approaches: a machine-learning model (Random Forest) and a formula-based model.\n\nFirst, the code loads the dataset and performs some initial data preparations. Descriptive statistics of the tracheal tube depth stratified by sex are then calculated and stored in a pickle file named \"table_0.pkl\".\n\nNext, the code preprocesses the data by creating dummy variables for the categorical variable 'sex'.\n\nThe code then proceeds to the analysis. It trains a Random Forest regressor using grid search for parameter tuning to predict the tracheal tube depth based on patient features: sex, age, height, and weight. The best hyperparameters are selected based on the mean squared error (MSE) as the evaluation metric.\n\nThe prediction results from the Random Forest model and a formula-based model (using a simple equation involving patient height) are compared in terms of MSE. The comparison is stored in a DataFrame named \"df1\" and saved as \"table_1.pkl\".\n\nAdditionally, the code calculates the residuals (the differences between the actual tracheal tube depth and the predicted values) for both models. The residuals are then subjected to a paired Wilcoxon test to compare the performance of the two models. The mean residuals and p-value from the Wilcoxon test are stored in a DataFrame named \"df2\" and saved as \"table_2.pkl\".\n\nFinally, the code saves additional results, including the total number of observations in the dataset and the best parameters found for the Random Forest model, in a pickle file named \"additional_results.pkl\".\n\nIn summary, this code performs a data analysis to determine the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth for pediatric patients using both a machine-learning model and a formula-based model. It compares the performance of these models and provides additional results for further analysis.\n\n```\n",

Existing methods to determine the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (OTTD) are either time-consuming or inaccurate. In this study, we present a novel machine-learning approach to accurately predict the OTTD in pediatric patients. We analyzed a dataset of 969 patients aged 0-7 years, and our results demonstrate that the Random Forest model outperforms the traditional formula-based model in accurately predicting the OTTD. The Random Forest model achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 1.04, significantly lower than the MSE of 3.76 obtained by the formula-based model. Additionally, the Wilcoxon test shows a significant improvement in the residuals for the Random Forest model compared to the formula-based model. The limitations of our study lie in the constraints of the dataset and the need for further validation in larger and more diverse cohorts. Nevertheless, our findings have important implications for clinical practice, providing a reliable and efficient method for determining the OTTD in pediatric patients.\n\\end{abstract}\n```\n",

We conducted multiple analyses comparing the performance of the machine-learning model with a formula-based model using different metrics.\n\nFirst, to understand the descriptive statistics of OTTD stratified by sex, we computed the mean and standard deviation. We found that the mean OTTD for females was 10.1 cm (SD: 1.65) and for males was 10.3 cm (SD: 1.86), as shown in Table~\\ref{table:statistics_by_sex}.

The machine-learning model, using the Random Forest algorithm, achieved a significantly lower MSE of 1.04 compared to the formula-based model with an MSE of 3.76, as shown in Table~\\ref{table:performance_model}.

Our analysis showed that the machine-learning model had a mean residual of -0.000822, whereas the formula-based model had a mean residual of -1.41. The Wilcoxon test confirmed that the difference in residuals between the two models was statistically significant (p-value $<$ 1e-6), as presented in Table~\\ref{table:comparison_model}.
