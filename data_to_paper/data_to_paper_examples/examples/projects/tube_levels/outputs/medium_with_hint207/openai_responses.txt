The exploration is conducted to gain insights into the dataset and understand its characteristics. \n\nInitially, the code loads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. \n\nNext, the code generates the following analysis steps and writes the results into the \"data_exploration.txt\" file:\n\n1. Data Size: The code determines the number of rows and columns in the dataset and writes this information to the file.\n\n2. Summary Statistics: The code calculates summary statistics for each column of the dataset, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, quartiles, and maximum values. These statistics provide a broad overview of the distribution and ranges of the numerical features in the dataset.\n\n3. Categorical Variables: The code identifies the categorical variables in the dataset and determines the top 5 most frequent values for each categorical variable. This analysis step helps understand the prevalence of different categories within each variable.\n\n4. Missing Values: The code counts the total number of missing or undefined values in the dataset and writes this information to the file. This step allows for an assessment of the completeness of the dataset and the potential need for handling missing values.\n\n5. Unknown/Undefined Numeric Values: The code checks for any specific numeric values that are used to represent unknown or undefined data. It identifies columns with such values and writes the column names and the count of unknown/undefined values to the file. This analysis helps identify any special codes used to represent missing or invalid data.\n\n6. Sex Distribution: The code calculates the count of each sex category in the dataset. Specifically, it determines the number of males and females and writes these counts to the file. This analysis provides an understanding of the gender distribution in the dataset.\n\nOverall, the code performs comprehensive data exploration on the provided dataset, providing valuable information about its size, summary statistics, categorical variables, missing values, unknown/undefined numeric values, and sex distribution. The results of this exploration are written to the \"data_exploration.txt\" file for reference and further analysis.\n\n```\n",

    "```latex\n\\section{Code Explanation}\n\nThe provided code conducts an analysis on a dataset related to determining the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) in pediatric patients who require mechanical ventilation. The dataset consists of 969 patient samples.\n\nThe analysis consists of the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Loading the dataset\nThe code reads the dataset file \"tracheal_tube_insertion.csv\" using the pandas library and stores it in a DataFrame variable called \"data\".\n\nStep 2: Descriptive Statistics\nThe code calculates descriptive statistics on the height and age of the patients stratified by sex. It groups the data by sex and computes the mean and standard deviation of height and age for female and male patients separately. The results are saved in a pickled DataFrame named \"table_0.pkl\".\n\nStep 3: Preprocessing\nNo preprocessing steps are required for this analysis.\n\nStep 4: Analysis\nThe analysis involves comparing the predictive power of a machine learning (ML) model against a formula-based model. The target variable is the tracheal tube depth determined by chest X-ray (tube_depth_G), and the feature variables are sex, age, height, and weight. \n\nThe code splits the dataset into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from the sklearn library. It then defines a Random Forest model and performs hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the best combination of parameters (n_estimators, max_depth, and min_samples_split).\n\nNext, the code predicts the tube depth using both the ML model and the formula-based model. For the formula-based model, the tube depth is estimated based on the patient's height divided by 10 and added to 5. \n\nThe code computes the mean squared residuals for both the ML model and the formula-based model by taking the square of the difference between the predicted tube depth and the actual tube depth. \n\nFinally, the code performs a paired t-test to compare the mean squared residuals of the two models and saves the results in a pickled DataFrame named \"table_1.pkl\". Additionally, it saves the training and testing scores of the ML model, as well as the best parameters found during the hyperparameter tuning, in a pickled dictionary named \"additional_results.pkl\".\n\nThe \"additional_results.pkl\" file contains the following information:\n- 'RF train score': The R-squared score of the Random Forest model on the training set.\n- 'RF test score': The R-squared score of the Random Forest model on the testing set.\n- 'RF best parameters': The best combination of hyperparameters found during the hyperparameter tuning process.\n\nThis analysis provides insights into the predictive power of a machine learning model compared to a formula-based model for determining the optimal tracheal tube depth in pediatric patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n```",

Our results show that the mean height for females was 65.4 cm (SD=18.7) and for males was 66.5 cm (SD=19.4). Furthermore, the mean age for females was 0.732 years (SD=1.4) and for males was 0.781 years (SD=1.47).\n\nNext, we compared the predictive power of our machine learning (ML) model with a formula-based model. The results are presented in Table \\ref{table:compare_ML_FBM}. The ML model outperformed the formula-based model, as evidenced by significantly lower mean squared residuals (1.49 vs. 3.81, p-value $<$1e-06). Our ML model, which incorporated patient characteristics such as sex, age, height, and weight, predicted the OTTD more accurately compared to the formula-based model. The optimized ML model was based on a random forest regressor, with the best parameters of max_depth=5, min_samples_split=5, and n_estimators=100.\n\nIn addition, our ML model achieved a train score of 0.6642 and a test score of 0.5803, indicating a satisfactory performance on the unseen test data. These results suggest that our ML model can effectively predict the OTTD in pediatric patients requiring respiratory support. However, it is important to note that further refinement and validation are necessary to improve the precision and safety of tracheal tube placement.\n\nIn summary, our analysis demonstrates the superiority of the ML model over the formula-based model in predicting the OTTD in pediatric patients. The ML model, based on patient characteristics, outperformed the formula-based model by achieving significantly lower mean squared residuals.

The dataset included 969 patients, and for each patient, the OTTD was determined by chest X-ray. \n\nFirst, to understand the descriptive statistics of height and age stratified by sex, we calculated the mean and standard deviation for each variable. As shown in Table~\\ref{table:descr_stats_height_age}, the mean height was 65.4 cm (SD=18.7) for females and 66.5 cm (SD=19.4) for males. The mean age was 0.732 years (SD=1.4) for females and 0.781 years (SD=1.47) for males. These findings provide important insights into the patient characteristics in our dataset.\n\nNext, we compared the predictive power of a machine learning (ML) model with a formula-based model in determining the OTTD. We used a Random Forest model and performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize the ML model's performance. The ML model showed a mean squared residual of 1.49, significantly outperforming the formula-based model, which had a mean squared residual of 3.81 (see Table~\\ref{table:compare_ML_FBM}). The paired t-test, with a p-value $<$ 1e-6, confirmed the statistically significant superiority of the ML model. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating patient characteristics such as sex, age, height, and weight in predicting the OTTD.\n\nFinally, we examined the RF model's performance using additional metrics. The RF model achieved a train score of 0.6642 and a test score of 0.5803. The best parameters for the RF model were found to be a max depth of 5, min samples split of 5, and 100 estimators. These results demonstrate the model's ability to generalize well on unseen data and its reasonable predictive accuracy.\n\nTaken together, these results highlight the superiority of the ML model over the formula-based model in predicting the OTTD in pediatric patients. Our findings emphasize the importance of incorporating patient characteristics into the decision-making process for tracheal tube depth determination. The RF model, with its optimized parameters, provides a valuable tool for accurately determining the OTTD in pediatric patients requiring respiratory support.\n\n```",
