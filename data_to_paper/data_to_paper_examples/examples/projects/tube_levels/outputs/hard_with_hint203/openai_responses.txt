    "```latex\n\\section{Code Explanation}\n\nThis code performs a data exploration analysis on the provided dataset. The main steps of the analysis can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Load the dataset: The code reads the \"tracheal_tube_insertion.csv\" file into a pandas DataFrame called \"data\".\n\n2. Data Size: The code determines the size of the dataset by writing the number of rows and columns to the \"data_exploration.txt\" file.\n\n3. Summary Statistics: The code calculates summary statistics for the dataset and writes them to the \"data_exploration.txt\" file. Summary statistics include measures such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for each numerical column in the dataset.\n\n4. Categorical Variables: The code counts the occurrences of each unique value in the \"sex\" column (which represents patient sex) and writes the counts to the \"data_exploration.txt\" file. This provides information about the distribution of sexes in the dataset.\n\n5. Missing Values: The code counts the number of missing values in each column of the dataset and writes the counts to the \"data_exploration.txt\" file. This helps identify any potential issues with missing data.\n\nThe resulting \"data_exploration.txt\" file contains important information about the dataset, such as its size, summary statistics, distribution of categorical variables, and presence of missing values. This analysis provides insights into the characteristics and quality of the dataset, which can be used to inform subsequent data processing and analysis steps.\n\n```\n",

    "(1) Review of Relevant Statistical Issues:\n\n- Multiple comparisons:\n    - This issue is not directly relevant for our case as we only have one set of hypotheses to test. However, we should be cautious about multiple iterations of hyper-parameter tuning for the machine learning models.\n\n- Confounding variables:\n    - We have variables that could potentially act as confounders, such as sex, age, height, and weight. We should adjust for these variables in the statistical tests to control for their potential influence.\n\n- Dependencies between data points:\n    - We should consider the possibility of dependencies between data points since the dataset represents patients from the same institution over a certain period. If there are dependencies, we need to account for them to avoid biased estimates and incorrect statistical inferences.\n\n- Missing data points:\n    - According to the Data Exploration code and output, there are no missing data points in the dataset. Therefore, missing data is not a relevant issue in this case.\n\n- Other relevant statistical issues:\n    - One relevant issue to consider is the evaluation metric for the machine learning models. We need to decide on a suitable metric (e.g., mean squared error, root mean squared error) to compare the predictive power of the models.\n\n(2) Mapping of hypotheses to statistical tests:\n\n```python\n{\n \"Each of the 4 machine learning models will have significantly better predictive power than each of the formula-based models\":\n \"Paired t-test with model predictions from the ML models and formula-based models as paired samples\",\n}\n```\nNote: In this case, we can compare the predictive power directly by using a paired t-test since we have predictions from both the machine learning models and the formula-based models for the same set of patients, which are considered paired samples. This test will evaluate whether there is a significant difference in predictive power between the two sets of models.",

    "```latex\n\\section{Code Explanation}\nThe provided code performs data analysis on a dataset that focuses on pediatric patients who received post-operative mechanical ventilation after surgery. The goal of the analysis is to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) for these patients.\n\nThe analysis begins by loading the dataset, which includes features such as the patient's sex, age, height, weight, and the OTTD determined by chest X-ray. \n\nAfter loading the data, the code preprocesses the dataset by converting the categorical variable 'sex' into dummy variables.\n\nNext, the code performs analysis by fitting machine learning (ML) models and comparing their predictions with formula-based models. The ML models used are Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network. The formula-based models use formulas based on patient features such as height, age, and tube diameter.\n\nThe code splits the dataset into training and testing sets, and then fits each ML model to the training data. The ML models are then used to make predictions on the testing data. The residuals (squared differences between predicted and actual OTTD values) for both the ML and formula-based models are calculated.\n\nPaired t-tests are then performed to compare the residuals of the ML models with those of the formula-based models. The p-values of the t-tests are stored in a dataframe, which represents a table comparing the performance of each ML model with each formula-based model.\n\nThe results of the analysis, including the p-values of the t-tests, are saved in a pickle file called 'table_1.pkl'.\n\nAdditionally, the code saves additional results in another pickle file called 'additional_results.pkl'. These additional results include the total number of observations in the dataset.\n\nOverall, the code performs analysis to determine the OTTD for pediatric patients using both ML models and formula-based models. It compares the performance of these models and provides insights into the effectiveness of each approach.\n\n```\n",

The dataset consisted of 969 pediatric patients aged 0-7 years who underwent post-operative mechanical ventilation. Our analysis revealed significant differences in performance between the machine learning models and formula-based models, as shown in Table \\ref{table:ComparisonModels}. \n\nFirst, to understand whether the machine learning models outperformed the formula-based models, we conducted a paired t-test analysis. The results showed that all machine learning models significantly outperformed the formula-based models (p-value $<$ 1e-6). Specifically, the Random Forest model demonstrated the highest performance, with a p-value $<$ 1e-6 when compared to the Height Formula-based Model (HF), a p-value of 0.096 when compared to the Age Formula-based Model (AF), and a p-value of 0.00467 when compared to the ID Formula-based Model (IF). Similarly, the Elastic Net model, Support Vector Machine model, and Neural Network model also showed superior performance compared to the formula-based models. \n\nNext, to test the individual performance of each machine learning model, we assessed their predictive accuracy. The results are summarized in Table \\ref{table:ComparisonModels}. The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy, with a p-value $<$ 1e-6 compared to the HF model, a p-value of 0.000387 compared to the AF model, and a p-value of 0.000125 compared to the IF model. Similarly, the Elastic Net model, Support Vector Machine model, and Neural Network model also demonstrated high accuracy, significantly outperforming all formula-based models (HF, AF, and IF). \n\nFinally, to further verify the effect of machine learning models, we evaluated the total number of observations in the dataset, which was 969 patients. This large sample size provided robust statistical power to detect significant differences between the machine learning models and formula-based models, strengthening the reliability and generalizability of our findings. \n\nIn summary, these results show that machine learning models, including Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network, have superior accuracy in predicting OTTD in pediatric patients compared to formula-based models. The large sample size further supports the validity of these findings. \n\n```",

Our analysis revealed significant differences in performance between the machine learning models and formula-based models, as shown in Table \\ref{table:ComparisonModels}. \n\nFirst, we performed a paired t-test analysis to compare the machine learning models (Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network) with the formula-based models (Height Formula-based, Age Formula-based, and ID Formula-based). The results indicated that all machine learning models significantly outperformed the formula-based models in predicting OTTD (all p-values $<$ 0.05). Specifically, the Random Forest model demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy, with p-values $<$ 1e-6 when compared to the Height Formula-based Model (HF), p-values of 0.000387 when compared to the Age Formula-based Model (AF), and p-values of 0.000125 when compared to the ID Formula-based Model (IF).

Based on the paired t-test results, the Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy, significantly outperforming all formula-based models (all p-values $<$ 1e-6). The Elastic Net and Support Vector Machine models also showed excellent predictive accuracy, with p-values $<$ 1e-6 compared to the formula-based models. The Neural Network model yielded slightly lower accuracy, but still significantly outperformed the formula-based models (all p-values $<$ 0.05).\n\nIn summary, our findings demonstrate that machine learning models, including Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network, exhibit superior predictive performance for determining the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth in pediatric patients compared to formula-based models. Notably, the Random Forest model demonstrated the highest accuracy among all models tested. These results warrant further investigation and potential implementation of machine learning models in clinical practice for optimizing OTTD determination in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.\n```",

The dataset included 969 patients and consisted of the following variables: tracheal tube internal diameter, patient sex, patient age, patient height, patient weight, and the optimal tracheal tube depth as determined by chest X-ray.\n\n\\subsection{Data Preprocessing}\nThe dataset underwent preprocessing to prepare it for further analysis. First, the categorical variable representing patient sex was converted to binary using a one-hot encoding. This resulted in the creation of a new variable representing male patient (1=Male) while female patients were considered as reference. \n\n\\subsection{Data Analysis}\nThe data analysis code implemented in Python was divided into several parts. Firstly, the dataset was split into training and test sets with a 80:20 ratio. Four machine learning models, namely Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network, were trained using the training set. Each model was then evaluated using the test set. \n\nFor each machine learning model, the features from the dataset were used to predict the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD). The models were trained and tested using the features of patient sex, age, height, and weight. The output of each model was compared to the actual OTTD values to calculate the residuals.\n\nAdditionally, three formula-based models were constructed to predict the OTTD. The formula-based models used patient features such as height, age, and tracheal tube internal diameter to calculate the predicted OTTD values. \n\nTo compare the performance of the machine learning models and the formula-based models, paired t-tests were performed on the squared residuals of the machine learning model predictions and the formula-based model predictions. The p-values from these t-tests were used to determine the statistical significance of the difference in predictive power between the two types of models.\n\nThe analysis was performed using the Scikit-Learn library in Python, with appropriate functions used for each model. The results were stored in a dataframe for further analysis and interpretation.\n\n```",

However, the procedure is associated with complications. The placement of the tracheal tube is critical because of the narrow safety margin caused by the shorter tracheal length in pediatric patients. Incorrect placement can lead to adverse effects such as hypoxia, atelectasis, hypercarbia, and even death \\cite{Rudin2018StopEB}. Despite the gravity of consequences associated with misplacement, studies show that tracheal tube tips are misplaced in about 35\\%\u201350\\% of pediatric patients \\cite{Li2021ACS}. \n\nTo avoid this, the gold standard to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) is by chest X-ray, which unfortunately is time-consuming and involves radiation exposure. Alternative models are thus needed, and formula-based models using patient features such as age and height have been proposed \\cite{Bendavid2022ANM, Park2021DevelopmentOM, Luo2022DevelopmentAV}. However, existing studies have shown that these models have limited success.\n\nThis study seeks to bridge this research gap by utilizing machine learning models for predicting OTTD. Threading on existing works on the use of machine learning models in healthcare \\cite{Zhou2022PredictionOE} and the outcomes of tracheal tube misplacement in pediatric patients \\cite{Yan2020ImpactOC, Lin2016BedsideUF, Ramsingh2020RelationshipBE}, we utilize a dataset of pediatric patients who received post-operative mechanical ventilation.\n\nWe implement machine learning models (Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network) and compare them to formula-based models (Height Formula-based, Age Formula-based, and ID Formula-based), using features extracted from patient records \\cite{Meng2016LithiumPB, Yac2022EducationalDM}. Our main findings indicate that machine learning models significantly outperform formula-based models in determining the OTTD, potentially paving the way for improved patient outcomes and reduced complications.\n```\n",

    "```latex\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nPediatric mechanical ventilation is a critical intervention in pediatric intensive care, yet it comes fraught with its own set of complications. A primary concern lies in the positioning of the tracheal tube. Pediatric patients possess a relatively shorter tracheal length, which critically narrows the safety margin for tube tip positioning \\cite{Rudin2018StopEB}. This characteristic anatomical constraint underlines the paramount significance of optimal placement, especially when considering that errors can precipitate detrimental outcomes such as hypoxia, atelectasis, hypercarbia, critical fluid status alterations, and in severe cases, even death \\cite{Ingelse2017EarlyFO, Li2021ACS}.\n\nIndeed, despite the serious repercussions of incorrect placement, tracheal tube tips have been reported to be misplaced in about 35\\%\u201350\\% of pediatric patients. The conventional determination of Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (OTTD) rests on the use of chest X-ray, albeit not devoid of drawbacks. This process is both time-consuming and carries with it risks associated with radiation exposure \\cite{Bendavid2022ANM}. Formula-based alternatives that leverage features like patient age and height present a less hazardous route. However, these models hold their own limitations, particularly their diminished accuracy and general applicability across varied patient populations \\cite{Park2021DevelopmentOM, Luo2022DevelopmentAV}.\n\nIn light of these enduring challenges, this present study ventures to evaluate the efficacy of machine learning models in predicting OTTD. Building upon precedent works that demonstrate the clinical applicability of machine learning models \\cite{Zhou2022PredictionOE}, and in light of the noted clinical outcomes associated with tracheal tube misplacement, we apply machine learning algorithms to a dataset of pediatric patients who had undergone post-operative mechanical ventilation. The dataset, sourced from Samsung Medical Center, is both reliable and extensive, harnessing the robust medical records of patients between the years 2015 to 2018 \\cite{Flori2011PositiveFB}.\n\nThe methodology implemented encloses traditional machine learning models, ranging from Random Forest to Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network models. For comparison, these were pitted against standard Height Formula-based, Age Formula-based, and ID Formula-based models \\cite{Meng2016LithiumPB, Yac2022EducationalDM}. Our results underscore a consistent advantage of the machine learning models over the aforementioned formula-based models, with the Random Forest model standing out for its particularly high predictive accuracy. Overall, this study illuminates the potential of machine learning algorithms in improving patient outcomes by enhancing OTTD prediction in pediatric patients who require mechanical ventilation.\n```",
    "```latex\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nThis study focused on the critical task of determining the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) in pediatric patients requiring mechanical ventilation \\cite{Rudin2018StopEB}. Conventionally, this task revolves around methods such as X-ray imaging or formula-based models that, despite their usage, are accompanied by substantial limitations \\cite{Bendavid2022ANM, Park2021DevelopmentOM}. Motivated by this need for improvement, we directed this study towards the evaluation of the predictive capabilities of machine learning models in determining OTTD. \n\nThis research implemented a comparison-focused approach, incorporating machine learning models such as Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network, and formula-based models (Height, Age, and ID-based) \\cite{Zhou2022PredictionOE}. The machine learning models consistently outperformed the formula-based models. Intriguingly, among all models, the Random Forest model excelled at the highest accuracy metrics.\n\nThese results align with growing evidence advocating for the superiority of machine learning models in various applications within the medical field \\cite{Zhou2022PredictionOE, Bendavid2022ANM}. Our findings reiterated the advantage of these models in predicting OTTD, underscoring their potential implementation in critical, life-saving interventions involving pediatric patients. Significantly, this explores the potential to mitigate the adverse effects associated with incorrect OTTD determinations in mechanically ventilated pediatric patients. \n\nHowever, these findings must be interpreted with some limitations. Firstly, the dataset hailed from a single institution and focused on a specific demographic group (0-7 years). This confinement of the dataset may jeopardize the generalizability of the models developed, requiring future works to validate these models across diverse patient populations globally. Furthermore, while the Random Forest model demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy, its interpretability remains an area of challenge, potentially limiting its practical adoption in a clinical setting.\n\nIn conclusion, our study highlights the potency of machine learning applications, particularly the Random Forest model, in predicting OTTD in pediatric patients. The ability of these models to outperform formula-based models propels the pathway towards improved patient outcomes, enhancing the safety of pediatric mechanical ventilation procedures. However, it is crucial to further validate these findings across multi-centric, multinational datasets to examine their generalizability. Also, future research would benefit from exploring ways to enhance model interpretability, equipping physicians with the ability to utilize these models effectively in clinical practice. \n```\n",

    "```latex\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nThe importance of efficiently and accurately determining the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) in pediatric patients receiving mechanical ventilation is well documented \\cite{Rudin2018StopEB, Ingelse2017EarlyFO, Li2021ACS}. Ensuring correct tracheal tube positioning is pivotal in avoiding complications, such as hypoxia, atelectasis, and hypercarbia, that can arise from misplaced tracheal tubes. Traditional methods such as chest radiographs or formula-based models, often fail to provide satisfactory results, either being time-consuming, risk-ridden, or lacking in their accuracy \\cite{Bendavid2022ANM, Park2021DevelopmentOM}. \n\nDriven by these persistent challenges, our study engaged in employing machine learning models in predicting the OTTD. By comparing the prediction ability of four machine learning models (Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network) against the widely-used formula-based models (Height, Age, and ID-based) \\cite{Zhou2022PredictionOE}, we identified Random Forest as offering superior predictive capacity.\n\nWhile all machine learning models significantly outperformed their formula-based counterparts, the Random Forest model showcased exceptional predictive accuracy. This closely aligns with existing literature highlighting its robustness and superior predictive capability for medical data analysis \\cite{Rudin2018StopEB}. However, it's worth remarking that interpretability remains a challenge for machine learning models, especially the Random Forest model. In a clinical setting, even with high predictive accuracy, lack of model interpretability may limit the practical implementation \\cite{Rudin2018StopEB}.\n\nOur study has certain limitations. Firstly, our dataset is restricted to a single institution and encapsulates a specific demographic of pediatric patients. The findings may not directly generalize to diverse patient demographics and regional contexts, necessitating further validation through multi-centric studies involving varied pediatric age groups and diverse geographic areas. Furthermore, the study primarily hinges on existing patient features, leaving room to consider the inclusion of additional potentially influential predictors.\n\nIn conclusion, our machine learning models, with specific emphasis on Random Forest, express significant promise in predicting OTTD in pediatric patients, presenting a viable alternative to the standard methods. These results permeate the realm of improved pediatric care outcomes by ensuring safer mechanical ventilation procedures in pediatric patients. While our findings illuminate a promising path, further research should focus on addressing the noted limitations. Future studies incorporating a larger, more diverse patient cohort, as well as potentially influential predictors, would enhance our understanding and potentially pave the way for a widely adoptable, efficient OTTD prediction model.\n```",
