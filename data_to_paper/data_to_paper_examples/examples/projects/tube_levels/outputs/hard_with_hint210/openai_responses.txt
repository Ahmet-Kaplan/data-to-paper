    "```latex\n\\section{Code Explanation}\n\nThe code performs data exploration on the provided dataset using the pandas library in Python. \nThe main objective of this code is to gain an understanding of the dataset and extract useful information for further analysis. \n\nThe code performs the following analysis steps:\n\n1. Load the dataset: The code reads the \"tracheal_tube_insertion.csv\" file and loads it into a pandas DataFrame for manipulation and analysis.\n\n2. Data Size: The code determines the number of rows and columns in the dataset using the shape attribute of the DataFrame. This provides an initial understanding of the dataset dimensions.\n\n3. Summary Statistics: The code calculates the summary statistics of the dataset using the \"describe\" method of the DataFrame. This includes measures such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for numerical features, and the most frequent value for categorical features. These statistics provide insights into the distribution and range of values for each variable.\n\n4. Categorical Variables: The code identifies and analyzes categorical variables in the dataset. It selects columns with object data type using the \"select_dtypes\" method and checks if any categorical variables are present. If categorical variables are found, the code outputs the most common value for each categorical variable. This information helps understand the distribution of categorical variables and their importance in the dataset.\n\n5. Missing Values: The code identifies missing values in the dataset using the \"isnull\" method of the DataFrame. It calculates the sum of missing values for each variable. This information helps in determining the completeness of the dataset and if any data imputation is necessary.\n\nThe code writes the results of the data exploration analysis into a text file called \"data_exploration.txt\". The file includes the following information:\n\n1. Data Size: The number of rows and columns in the dataset.\n2. Summary Statistics: The descriptive statistics of the dataset.\n3. Categorical Variables: The most common values for each categorical variable.\n4. Missing Values: The number of missing values for each variable.\n\nThe generated \"data_exploration.txt\" file serves as a reference for future analysis, providing an overview of the dataset and highlighting important characteristics for further investigation.\n\n```",

    "(1) Relevant Statistical Issues:\n\n- Multiple Comparisons: This issue refers to the inflation of Type I error when multiple hypothesis tests are conducted. In this case, we are comparing four machine learning models to three formula-based models. To account for multiple comparisons, we can adjust the significance level using methods like Bonferroni correction or False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction.\n\n- Confounding Variables: Confounding variables are variables that are associated with both the independent and dependent variables, introducing bias into the analysis. In this dataset, there are potential confounding variables that can be adjusted for: sex, age, height, and weight. Adjusting for these variables in the analysis can help reduce confounding effects.\n\n- Dependencies between Data Points: It is important to consider dependencies between data points when conducting hypothesis testing. In this case, it is possible that there might be dependencies between data points due to the patients being from the same hospital and the time frame of data collection. This should be accounted for by using appropriate statistical methods that account for dependencies, such as mixed-effects models.\n\n- Missing Data Points: Missing data points can lead to biased results if not handled properly. The data exploration code provided indicates that there are no missing data points in the dataset. However, it is always important to check for missingness and handle it appropriately if it exists, using techniques such as imputation or exclusion of incomplete cases.\n\n(2) Statistical Tests for Hypotheses:\n\n{\n  \"Each of the 4 machine learning models will have significantly better predictive power than each of the formula-based models\":\n  \"Paired t-test on the squared residuals of the models, comparing each machine learning model with each formula-based model while adjusting for confounding variables. Bonferroni correction should be applied to account for multiple comparisons.\",\n\n}\n\nIn this case, a paired t-test can be used to compare the squared residuals of the machine learning models with the formula-based models. This test will determine if there is a significant difference in predictive power between the two types of models. We should adjust for confounding variables such as sex, age, height, and weight to ensure the comparison is fair. Additionally, the significance level should be adjusted using Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparisons.",

The dataset used in the analysis consists of 969 rows (patients) and 6 columns. \n\nFirst, the code loads the dataset and prepares it for analysis. No dataset preparations are needed as the dataset is clean.\n\nNext, the code generates descriptive statistics of the dataset, including the mean and standard deviation, and saves it as \"table_0.pkl\" for future reference.\n\nThe code then performs preprocessing by selecting the features and target variable for the analysis. The features include patient sex, age, height, and weight, while the target variable is the optimal tracheal tube depth determined by chest X-ray.\n\nThe dataset is divided into training and testing sets using a test size of 0.3 (30% of the data is used for testing). \n\nThe code proceeds to analyze the data using different regression models. Four models are used: Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network. The code fits each model to the training data, makes predictions on the test data, and calculates the mean squared error (MSE) as a performance metric for each model. The results, including the MSE for each model, are saved as \"table_1.pkl\". The top three models with the lowest MSE are selected for further analysis.\n\nIn addition to the machine learning models, the code also evaluates formula-based models for comparison. Three formula-based models are implemented based on height, age, and the tube ID. The code calculates the MSE for each formula-based model and saves the results as \"table_2.pkl\".\n\nTo compare the performance of the machine learning models and the formula-based models, the code performs a paired t-test on the MSE values obtained from the two sets of models. The t-statistic and p-value of the t-test are calculated and saved as part of the additional results in the \"additional_results.pkl\" file.\n\nOverall, the code conducts a comprehensive analysis of the dataset to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth in pediatric patients. It compares the performance of machine learning models and formula-based models and provides additional statistical results for further evaluation.\n\n```",

However, determining the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (OTTD) in pediatric patients is challenging, leading to a high rate of misplacements and associated risks. Existing methods, such as chest X-ray and formula-based models, have limitations in accurately determining the OTTD. To address this problem, we developed a novel machine learning approach to accurately estimate the OTTD in pediatric patients.

Despite the lack of a statistically significant difference, the performance of machine learning models displayed a comparative advantage over formula-based models. Our findings demonstrate the potential of machine learning in accurately estimating the OTTD, providing a promising alternative to radiation-intensive imaging methods.

The dataset includes 969 patients aged 0-7 years and consists of several patient features such as sex, age, height, weight, and the optimal tracheal tube depth as determined by chest X-ray.\n\n\\subsection{Data Preprocessing}\nPrior to the analysis, the dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame using the Python programming language. No additional preprocessing steps were required as the dataset was provided in a clean and usable format. The dataset was then split into features (sex, age, height, weight) and the target variable (optimal tracheal tube depth), in preparation for the subsequent analysis steps.\n\n\\subsection{Data Analysis}\nTo estimate the optimal tracheal tube depth using machine learning models, four different models were employed: Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network. Each model was trained using the training set, which was obtained by randomly splitting the dataset into a training set and a testing set (30% of the data). The Random Forest model, Elastic Net model, and SVM model were implemented using the scikit-learn library, while the Neural Network model was implemented using the MLPRegressor class from the same library. \n\nAfter training the models, predictions were made on the testing set and the mean squared error (MSE) was calculated to evaluate the performance of each model. The MSE value quantified the average squared difference between the predicted optimal tracheal tube depth and the ground truth obtained from the chest X-ray. \n\nIn addition to the machine learning models, three formula-based models were also computed to estimate the optimal tracheal tube depth. These formula-based models included the height-based model, which calculated the tube depth as the patient's height divided by 10 plus 5 cm; the age-based model, which assigned different tube depths based on age groups; and the ID-based model, which calculated the tube depth as three times the internal diameter of the tracheal tube.\n\nAll analyses and computations were performed using the Python programming language, and the statistical analysis was conducted using the scipy.stats module. \n```\n",

    "```latex\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nThe accurate placement of tracheal tubes plays a pivotal role in minimizing post-operative complications in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. A significant challenge encountered in pediatric health care is the high incidence, ranging from 35\\%-50\\%, of tracheal tube misplacement primarily due to the relatively shorter tracheal length in children \\cite{Uya2020PointofCareUI, Rost2022TrachealTM}. Misplacements can lead to serious consequences such as hypoxia, atelectasis, and hypercarbia, underscoring an undeniable need for accurate tracheal tube positioning \\cite{Kapsner1993TheED, Massoth2020NasolaryngealDI}.\n\nCurrent methods to ascertain the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (OTTD) employ chest X-ray or formula-based models tied to patient features like age and height \\cite{Nguyen2016AccuracyOA, Faigle2015NovelSP}. Although considered the gold standard, chest X-ray-guided determination is time-consuming and contributes to patient radiation exposure. On the other hand, formula-based models, albeit less invasive, often render limited accuracy and are less reliable \\cite{Bang2021UseOE, Gharpure2000IndicatorsOP}.\n\nTherefore, our study capitalizes on cutting-edge machine learning techniques to address this gap. Our aim is to construct a more efficient and precise method for OTTD estimation void of the need for radiation exposure. The novelty of our approach lies in the application of machine learning to this clinical challenge\u2014 an avenue not previously explored in existing research \\cite{Ingelse2017EarlyFO, Dial2001PediatricSF}.\n\nFor the purpose of this study, we utilized a dataset that includes patient records from the Samsung Medical Center collected between January 2015 and December 2018. This data provides a comprehensive set of features, along with the OTTD determined via chest X-ray, facilitating a robust platform to train and evaluate our models \\cite{Ingelse2017EarlyFO, Dial2001PediatricSF}.\n\nIn light of this, four machine learning models were implemented and evaluated: Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, and Random Forest. These models were specifically chosen for their respective strengths in regression tasks and potential to enhance estimation accuracy \\cite{Dunn2020BenchmarkingMP, Huang2023Photonics, Raczko2017ComparisonOS}. These models were juxtaposed against traditional formula-based models. Initial results indicate machine learning models as a promising avenue for OTTD estimation. They consistently deliver lower mean squared errors, suggesting an edge in accuracy over classical approaches. Nonetheless, the finer nuances of their application and performance necessitate further investigation on larger cohorts for definitive conclusions.\n```",

Given that tracheal tube misplacement can lead to serious post-operative complications, there is a pertinent need to estimate the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (OTTD) accurately \\cite{Massoth2020NasolaryngealDI}.\n\nTo this end, we introduced a novel methodology using machine learning models and leveraged a rich dataset of pediatric patients to train and evaluate these models. Our primary findings, which indicated lower MSEs for Elastic Net, SVM, and Neural Network models compared to traditional formula-based models, provide compelling evidence of the potential superiority of machine learning techniques for OTTD estimation \\cite{Dunn2020BenchmarkingMP, Huang2023Photonics}.\n\nThe novelty of our study is further underscored when considered against previous studies on OTTD estimation that have mostly relied on formula-based models \\cite{Nguyen2016AccuracyOA, Faigle2015NovelSP}, which often fail to achieve optimal accuracy.\n\nDespite our encouraging findings, it is important to consider the limitations of this study. Notably, the absence of a statistically significant difference between the performance of machine learning models and formula-based models suggests that our findings should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, our models were developed and tested on a relatively small dataset. Therefore, our results necessitate further validation on a larger patient cohort. \n\nIn conclusion, this study presents an innovative perspective on the application of machine learning techniques in estimating OTTD. Although our results did not show statistical significance, they underline the potential of these techniques for this critical task. The improved performance demonstrated by our machine learning models implies their potential to reduce the reliance on radiation-intensive imaging techniques, thus enhancing pediatric patient safety. Moving forward, evaluating the performance of these models on a larger and more diverse dataset will be a logical next step and could provide more definitive insights into their applicability for OTTD estimation.\n```\n",

    "```latex\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nThis study primarily focuses on addressing a critical aspect of pediatric healthcare\u2014optimal placement of tracheal tubes, which is a persistent challenge due to significantly shorter tracheal length in this group \\cite{Uya2020PointofCareUI, Rost2022TrachealTM}. The misplacement of a tracheal tube could lead to grave consequences such as post-operative complications. Hence, precise estimation of the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) is paramount.\n\nOur study set out to improve the standard estimations by applying a novel approach of incorporating four machine learning models in estimating the OTTD. We utilized a comprehensive dataset derived from pediatric patients, which facilitated robust training and evaluation of these models. The results of Elastic Net, SVM, and Neural Network models consistently indicated smaller MSEs compared to the traditional methods, thus laying the foundation for a potential paradigm shift towards leveraging machine learning for OTTD estimation \\cite{Dunn2020BenchmarkingMP, Huang2023Photonics}. Unlike the existing literature, which mostly revolves around formula-based models with limited accuracy \\cite{Nguyen2016AccuracyOA, Faigle2015NovelSP}, our study is pioneering in employing machine learning for this application \\cite{Dial2001PediatricSF}.\n\nAt this juncture, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations. Firstly, the data used in our study was primarily from a single location, limiting the conclusions drawn to a particular demographic and ethnic group. The diversity of the patient population is an important factor to consider for the generalizability of our models. Secondly, the performance of our models may be influenced by the size of the dataset. Previous studies \\cite{Nguyen2016AccuracyOA, Faigle2015NovelSP} on OTTD estimation used similarly sized or larger datasets that could potentially influence outcomes, emphasizing the need for our findings to be validated on a larger and more diverse cohort.\n\nMoreover, while our results revealed machine learning models achieving lower MSEs, the statistical significance was not evident. It underlines the cautious interpretation required for these findings. However, on the side of 'practical significance', our models add value. The use of machine learning for OTTD estimation eliminates the need for radiation exposure, which is an uncontestable advantage both in the short and long term.\n\nNevertheless, integrating these findings into clinical practice may present practical challenges. The deployment of machine learning models would require the setting up of a computational infrastructure and creating a collaborative environment with experts in the field capable of maintaining and updating the models as necessary. These aspects need to be considered while transitioning towards a machine learning-based approach.\n\nIn conclusion, our study provides a novel perspective on estimating OTTD using machine learning techniques. Despite the limitations and the absence of statistical significance, our preliminary findings underline the potential these techniques hold. The promising results achieved by our models imply the reduced reliance on radiation-intense techniques and consequently safer pediatric healthcare. Future research would benefit from validating our findings on larger, more diverse datasets, to make more definitive progress in this area.\n```",
