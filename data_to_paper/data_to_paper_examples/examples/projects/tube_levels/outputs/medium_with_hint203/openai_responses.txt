The dataset includes patient information such as sex, age, height, weight, and the optimal tracheal tube depth as determined by chest X-ray.\n\nThe code first loads the dataset from a CSV file into a pandas data frame. It then proceeds to explore the data and writes the results to a text file named \"data_exploration.txt\".\n\nThe key analysis steps in the code include:\n\n1. Data Size: The code writes the number of rows and columns in the dataset to the text file. This provides an overview of the dataset's size.\n\n2. Summary Statistics: The code calculates and writes summary statistics for numerical variables in the dataset, such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. This information helps to understand the distribution and range of values for each variable.\n\n3. Categorical Variables: The code identifies and writes the most common value for each categorical variable in the dataset. This provides insights into the predominant categories within each variable and can be useful for understanding the data's composition.\n\n4. Missing Values: The code checks for missing values in the dataset and writes the number of missing values for each variable to the text file. This information helps identify any data gaps or potential issues involving missing data.\n\nOverall, the code performs a thorough exploration of the dataset, providing important insights into its structure, summary statistics, categorical variables, and missing values. The outputted \"data_exploration.txt\" file serves as a record of these findings, which can be referenced for further analysis and as a reference for the research study.\n```\n",

    "(1) Review of Relevant Statistical Issues:\n\n- Multiple Comparisons: Multiple comparisons may not be relevant for our case as we have a single comparison between the machine-learning model and the formula-based model.\n\n- Confounding Variables: The dataset provides variables such as sex, age, height, and weight. These variables could potentially act as confounders and may need to be adjusted for in the analysis.\n\n- Dependencies between Data Points: We need to ensure that the assumptions of independence are met. If there are dependencies between the data points, appropriate statistical methods should be used to account for them.\n\n- Missing Data Points: According to the data exploration code and output provided, there are no missing values in the dataset. Therefore, missing data is not a relevant statistical issue for this analysis.\n\n- Other Relevant Statistical Issues: \n  - Model Evaluation: We need to consider appropriate metrics to evaluate the performance of the machine-learning model, such as mean squared error or R-squared.\n\n(2) Statistical Tests for Each Hypothesis:\n\n{\n \"The machine-learning model will have a significantly better predictive power than the formula-based model\":\n \"Paired t-test between the squared residuals of the machine-learning model and the formula-based model to compare their predictive power.

It compares the predicted values with the actual OTTD values and computes summary statistics, including the mean and standard deviation of the predicted and actual values, as well as the mean and standard deviation of the residuals.\n\nThe code then prepares the data for a Random Forest (RF) regression model by selecting the relevant features and splitting the data into training and testing sets. It defines a grid of possible parameter values for the RF model and performs hyper-parameter tuning using grid search and cross-validation to identify the optimal combination of parameters. The best performing RF model is trained using the optimal parameters obtained from the grid search.\n\nAfter training the RF model, the code predicts the OTTD using the model and calculates the residuals by subtracting the predicted values from the actual values. It computes the square of the residuals for both the formula-based and RF models.\n\nTo compare the performance of the two models, the code performs a paired t-test on the squared residuals. The t-test determines if there is a significant difference between the squared residuals of the formula-based and RF models, indicating which model provides a better fit to the data.\n\nFinally, the code stores the summary statistics, optimal RF model parameters and performance, t-test results, and additional information (such as the total number of observations) in separate pickle files for further analysis.\n\nThe \"additional_results.pkl\" file contains the following information: \n- \"Total number of observations\": the total number of patients included in the dataset.\n\nThis analysis provides insights into the prediction of the optimal tracheal tube depth for pediatric patients using both a formula-based model and a machine-learning model based on Random Forest regression. The results can aid in improving the accuracy and efficiency of determining OTTD, decreasing the risk of complications associated with tracheal tube misplacement in pediatric patients during mechanical ventilation.\n\n```\n",

However, determining the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) poses challenges. Current methods, relying on chest X-ray or formula-based models, have limitations in accuracy and efficiency. To address this, we present a dataset of pediatric patients aged 0-7 years who underwent post-operative mechanical ventilation. We compare the performance of a machine learning model (Random Forest) with a formula-based model in predicting OTTD. Our findings show that the machine learning model outperforms the formula-based model, as indicated by the significantly lower squared residuals. The optimal parameters of the Random Forest model are determined as 200 estimators and a maximum depth of 5.

The dataset utilized in this study included a total of 969 pediatric patients (aged 0-7 years) who received post-operative mechanical ventilation at Samsung Medical Center. \n\nInitially, we performed an analysis to contrast the predicted OTTD generated using the height-based formula (which calculates OTTD by adding 5 to a tenth of the patient's height in cm) and the actual OTTD, determined by chest X-ray. As tabulated in Table \\ref{table:table1}, the formula-derived mean predicted OTTD was 11.6 cm, which is significantly greater than the observed mean OTTD of 10.2 cm. The formula-based model exhibited a mean residual of 1.41 cm, thus revealing a persistent overestimation of OTTD. This discrepancy underscores the need for alternative models that cater to the anatomical considerations of pediatric patients.\n\nTo address this concern, we developed a Random Forest model and tuned its parameters using a grid search methodology, cross-validated to evade over-fitting. The optimal parameters and resulting performance of the Random Forest model are shown in Table \\ref{table:table2}. The optimized configuration constituted of 200 estimators and a maximum depth of 5. The Random Forest model outperformed the formula-based model, yielding a lower mean squared error of 1.39 on the test set, demonstrative of its superior accuracy.\n\nSubsequently, we executed a paired t-test to examine the squared residuals of the Random Forest model against the formula-based model. Table \\ref{table:table3} displays a significant t-statistic of 15.1, with a corresponding p-value $<$ 1e-06, thereby indicating a significant reduction in the squared residuals with the machine learning approach compared to the formula-based model.\n\nIn summary, these results evidently highlight the upper hand of the Random Forest model over the conventional formula-based model in accurately predicting the optimal tracheal tube depth for pediatric patients. With the advantaged parameters, the Random Forest model not only offers more precise predictions of OTTD but also reduces the squared residuals as against those to the formula-based model. Consequently, the potential of machine learning techniques in enriching the accuracy of tracheal tube depth determination in pediatrics undergoing mechanical ventilation is further consolidated.\n```",

Formula-based models have limitations in accurately predicting OTTD due to the narrow safety margin and anatomical differences in pediatric patients. In this study, we aim to enhance the accuracy of OTTD prediction by developing a machine learning model using patient electronic health records. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 969 pediatric patients who received post-operative mechanical ventilation, we compare the performance of a machine learning model, Random Forest, with a formula-based model. Our findings demonstrate that the Random Forest model outperforms the formula-based model, providing more accurate predictions of OTTD. The optimized Random Forest model includes 200 estimators and a maximum depth of 5. The application of machine learning techniques in determining tracheal tube depth in pediatric patients can potentially improve patient outcomes and reduce complications related to tube misplacement. Future research could focus on incorporating additional patient features and validating the developed models in external datasets.\n\\end{abstract}\n```\n"
