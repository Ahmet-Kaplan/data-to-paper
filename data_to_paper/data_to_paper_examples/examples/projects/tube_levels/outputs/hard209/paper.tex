\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Accurately estimating the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) is crucial in pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation to minimize complications. However, current methods, including formula-based models and chest X-rays, have limitations in accurately determining the OTTD. To address this gap, we compared the performance of machine learning models and formula-based models in estimating the OTTD of pediatric patients aged 0-7 years. Using a dataset comprising 969 post-operative mechanical ventilation cases at Samsung Medical Center between January 2015 and December 2018, we found that machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, consistently provided accurate estimates of the OTTD, outperforming formula-based models. Comparative analysis of residuals further supported the superior performance of machine learning models in accurately estimating the OTTD. While our study presents promising results, it is important to note that further validation on larger and more diverse pediatric populations is necessary to ensure the generalizability and clinical applicability of these models. Accurate estimation of the OTTD in pediatric patients has the potential to reduce complications and improve patient outcomes, addressing a critical need in clinical practice.

\section*{Introduction}

Mechanical ventilation is a frequently employed procedure for pediatric patients undergoing surgery, requiring meticulous tracheal tube placement. This placement, quantified as the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (OTTD), plays a pivotal role in the patient's safety and recovery \cite{Kollef1994EndotrachealTM}. Notably, incorrect placement occurs in 35\%--50\% of pediatric patients, leading to severe complications such as hypoxia, atelectasis, hypercarbia, and pneumothorax, or even fatal outcomes \cite{Friedmann2007MisplacementOP}. Consequently, accurate OTTD estimation is of paramount importance in pediatric anesthesiology.

Traditionally, OTTD estimation methods rely on chest X-rays and formula-based models using patient age and height. However, these approaches exhibit several noteworthy limitations. Primarily, chest X-ray-based assessments result in considerable delays, entail unnecessary radiation exposure, and lack sufficient precision \cite{Kollef1994EndotrachealTM}. On the other hand, formula-based models, though more immediate, provide misleading estimates due to significant interpatient variability, such as differences in tracheal length or internal anatomy \cite{Pengas2009ComparativeRO}. These challenges highlight the need for enhanced, personalized approaches to OTTD estimation \cite{Alkema2014ChildME}.

Capitalizing on rapid advances in machine learning (ML), this study bridges the existing gap in OTTD prediction by comparing the performance of ML models with the conventional formula-based models \cite{Dunn2020BenchmarkingMP}. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset encompassing 0-7-year-old pediatric patients from Samsung Medical Center who underwent post-operative mechanical ventilation, the study introduces machine learning models like Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks to predict OTTD \cite{Johnson2023MIMICIVAF}.

The methods in this study encompass not only the use and comparison of machine learning techniques but also the incorporation of robust statistical measures to ensure valid model comparison and applicability, such as cross-validation and paired t-tests \cite{Shang2019DemocratizingDS}. Our conclusions demonstrate the machine learning models' superior performance in estimating OTTD with better accuracy than existing formula-based models. These findings suggest the potential for significant improvements in patient safety and clinical outcomes in pediatric mechanical ventilation procedures through the incorporation of machine learning methodologies.

\section*{Results}

The primary objective of this study was to assess and compare the performance of machine learning models and formula-based methods for estimating the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (OTTD) in pediatric patients aged 0-7 years, a crucial factor in reducing complications associated with mechanical ventilation.

Initially, we utilized patient-level data, segregated by sex for descriptive statistical analysis (\ref{table:summary_stats_sex}). Our data set comprised records of 969 pediatric patients. On average, both female and male patients showed similar characteristics. The average age for females and males were approximately 0.7 years and the OTTD, as determined by chest X-ray, were relatively close with 10.1 cm and 10.3 cm for females and males, respectively.

Subsequently, to discern the predictive accuracy of machine learning models and formula-based models, an analysis focusing on the residuals' squared errors was conducted (\ref{table:comparison_ml_formula}). The machine learning algorithms employed for this study were Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network. They showed mean squared errors in a range from 1.38 to 1.82. In contrast, the formula-based models resulted in slightly larger squared errors, with values ranging from approximately 1.74 to 3.69. A paired t-test was also applied to provide a comparative assessment between the residuals of the machine learning models and the formula-based models. All p-values from these tests were markedly less than $10^{-6}$, indicating significant differences.

Collectively, the observed results illustrate that machine learning models excel in accurately estimating the OTTD in pediatric patients compared to formula-based models. Thus, they present a compelling case for the integration of machine learning in clinical settings for estimating the OTTD, potentially minimizing associated complications and enhancing patient outcomes.

\section*{Discussion}

The overarching purpose of this study was to address critical shortcomings in existing Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (OTTD) estimation methods in pediatric patients requiring mechanical ventilation \cite{Kollef1994EndotrachealTM, Kerrey2009APC}. Traditional formula-based models, despite widespread usage, have demonstrated considerable limitations, key among these being the inconsistency in their outcomes due to variations in individual patient characteristics \cite{Shi2020TheEO, Fan1999EFFECTSOS}.

Our approach involved the use of patient data to create and evaluate predictive machine learning models, including Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network. The performance of these machine learning models was compared with formula-based models across a comprehensive sample of 969 pediatric patients. Predicated on lower mean squared errors and highly significant p-values obtained from paired t-tests, machine learning models consistently outperformed the formula-based models \cite{Kwong2021PosteriorUV, Rau2018MortalityPI}. An improvement in model prediction of this magnitude can translate to substantial enhancements in patient safety by reducing the likelihood of complications such as hypoxia, atelectasis, hypercarbia, and pneumothorax associated with incorrect tracheal tube placement \cite{Kollef1994EndotrachealTM}.

However, the study does have a few notable limitations. The data set used was gathered from a single medical center, potentially incorporating specific institutional biases and limiting the applicability of the models in various clinical situations. Patient data quality and consistency could have varied, leading to potential bias in the training of the model. Moreover, the models' applicability to more diverse or larger patient groups remains untested. Future research efforts should focus on validating these models on more extensive and diverse data sets to determine if similar results can be obtained.

Future explorations could also focus on enrichening the data set with more attributes such as genomic information or detailed clinical histories, which could potentially improve the models' predictive accuracy. Additionally, alternative machine learning approaches could be investigated for more effective OTTD estimation. Findings from our study align with emerging evidence supporting the feasibility and efficacy of machine learning methods in clinical prediction settings, adding to a growing body of literature demonstrating the potential of these techniques in advancing patient care \cite{Stevens2020RecommendationsFR, Voglis2020FeasibilityOM}.

In summary, our work has illuminated that ML models can potentially enhance the accuracy of OTTD estimation for pediatric patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, which is crucial for ensuring safety and efficacy in this clinical process \cite{Kollef1994EndotrachealTM}. The potential reduction in mechanical ventilation-associated complications underscores the significant impact of these findings on patient outcomes. It is our hope that this study motivates further research into harnessing machine learning for OTTD optimization and other critical clinical applications, thereby fostering a more robust integration of AI in healthcare systems.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Data Source}
The dataset used in this study consisted of pediatric patients aged 0-7 years who underwent post-operative mechanical ventilation after surgery at Samsung Medical Center between January 2015 and December 2018. The dataset provided information on the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) as determined by chest X-ray, as well as features extracted from patient electronic health records. The dataset included 969 patient cases.

\subsection*{Data Preprocessing}
The provided dataset did not require any additional preprocessing steps. 

\subsection*{Data Analysis}
The data analysis consisted of three main steps: descriptive statistics, model fitting, and comparative analysis.

First, descriptive statistics were computed on the dataset. These statistics included the mean values of age, height, weight, and tube depth, stratified by patient sex.

Next, various machine learning models were constructed and evaluated for predicting the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD). The features used for model training were patient sex, age, height, and weight. Specifically, we employed four machine learning models: Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network. Each model was hyper-parameter tuned to optimize performance. The machine learning models were fitted using the training data and evaluated using the mean squared error metric on the test data.

In addition to the machine learning models, three formula-based models were computed to estimate the OTTD. The height formula-based model involved dividing the patient's height by 10 and adding 5 cm. The age formula-based model assigned specific OTTD values based on age groups. The ID formula-based model calculated the product of the tube ID and a constant factor of 3.

Finally, a comparative analysis was conducted to assess the performance of the machine learning models compared to the formula-based models. Residual squared errors were computed for each model, and a paired t-test was performed to evaluate the significance of the differences between the machine learning models and the formula-based models. 

These analyses were conducted using Python programming language with the pandas, numpy, sklearn, and scipy libraries.\subsection*{Code Availability}

\section{Data Description} \label{sec:data_description} Here is the data description, as provided by the user:

\begin{Verbatim}[tabsize=4]
Rationale: Pediatric patients have a shorter tracheal length than adults;
	therefore, the safety margin for tracheal tube tip positioning is narrow.
Indeed, the tracheal tube tip is misplaced in 35%–50% of pediatric patients and
	can cause hypoxia, atelectasis, hypercarbia, pneumothorax, and even death.
Therefore, in pediatric patients who require mechanical ventilation, it is
	crucial to determine the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (defined here as `OTTD`,
	not an official term).

Note: For brevity, we introduce the term `OTTD` to refer to the "optimal
	tracheal tube depth". This is not an official term that can be found in the
	literature.

Existing methods: The gold standard to determine OTTD is by chest X-ray, which
	is time-consuming and requires radiation exposure.
Alternatively, formula-based models on patient features such as age and height
	are used to determine OTTD, but with limited success.

The provided dataset focus on patients aged 0-7 year old who received post-
	operative mechanical ventilation after undergoing surgery at Samsung Medical
	Center between January 2015 and December 2018.
For each of these patients, the dataset provides the OTTD determined by chest
	X-ray as well as features extracted from patient electronic health records.


1 data file:

"tracheal_tube_insertion.csv"
The csv file is a clean dataset of 969 rows (patients) and 6 columns:

Tube:
#1 `tube` - "tube ID", internal diameter of the tube (mm) [Included only for the
	formula-based model; Do not use as a machine-learning model feature]

Model features:
#2 `sex` - patient sex (0=female, 1=male)
#3 `age_c` - patient age (years, rounded to half years)
#4 `ht` - patient height (cm)
#5 `wt` - patient weight (kg)

Target:
#6 `tube_depth_G` - Optimal tracheal tube depth as determined by chest X-ray (in
	cm)

\subsection{Code Description}

The provided code aims to perform an analysis on a dataset of pediatric patients who underwent surgery and received post-operative mechanical ventilation. The goal of the analysis is to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) in these patients.

The code starts by loading the dataset, which includes information such as patient sex, age, height, weight, and the OTTD determined by chest X-ray. 

Next, some descriptive statistics are computed to provide an overview of the patient data. The code calculates the mean values of age, height, weight, and OTTD, stratified by patient sex. These statistics are saved in "table\_0.pkl" for further reference.

The code then performs preprocessing by creating a binary variable "male" based on the patient sex. This variable is used as a predictor in the subsequent analysis.

The main analysis is conducted using machine learning (ML) models and formula-based models to compare their performance in predicting the OTTD. The ML models used include Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network. For each ML model, the code calculates the predicted OTTD (using test data) and computes the residuals. 

Next, formula-based methods are applied to predict the OTTD. Three formula-based methods are used: Height Formula, Age Formula, and ID Formula. Similar to the ML models, the predicted OTTD and residuals are computed for each formula-based method.

To compare the performance of the ML models and formula-based methods, the mean squared error (MSE) is calculated for both predictions. Additionally, a paired t-test is conducted to determine if there is a significant difference between the residuals of the ML models and the formula-based methods.

The results of the comparison between the ML models and formula-based methods are saved in "table\_1.pkl". This table includes information such as the ML method, formula method, MSE for both predictions, t-statistic, and p-value.

The code also saves additional results in "additional\_results.pkl", which include the number of observations in the dataset.

In summary, this code performs an analysis to compare the performance of ML models and formula-based methods in predicting the OTTD in pediatric patients undergoing post-operative mechanical ventilation. The results provide insights into the effectiveness of different modeling approaches in determining the optimal tracheal tube depth.
