    "\\section{Code Explanation}\n\nThe provided Data Exploration code aims to analyze the dataset and provide useful information about its size, summary statistics, categorical variables, and missing values. The code imports the necessary modules and loads the dataset into a dataframe.\n\nFirst, the code retrieves the size of the dataset by counting the number of rows and columns and writes these values to the output file.\n\nNext, the code calculates and writes the summary statistics of the dataset to the output file. This includes measures such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and quartiles for numerical columns in the dataset.\n\nThe code then analyzes categorical variables in the dataset. It identifies the columns that contain categorical data and determines the most common value (mode) for each of these categorical variables. This information is written to the output file.\n\nAfter analyzing categorical variables, the code checks for missing values in the dataset. It calculates the total number of missing values and displays this information in the output file. Additionally, it provides the count of missing values for each feature in the dataset if any are found.\n\nOverall, the code performs data exploration by examining the dataset, providing a summary of its size, summary statistics, categorical variables, and missing values. The information generated by the code is saved in the \"data_exploration.txt\" file, which can be further analyzed and used for data understanding and decision-making processes in research studies.",
    "```latex\n\\section{Code Explanation}\nThe data exploration code aims to provide an initial analysis of the dataset in order to gain insights into its structure and characteristics. \n\nFirst, the code loads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. \n\nThe code then performs the following analysis steps:\n\n\\subsection{Data Size}\nThe code calculates the number of rows and columns in the dataset and writes this information to the output file. This provides an overview of the dataset's size.\n\n\\subsection{Summary Statistics}\nThe code calculates summary statistics for the numerical columns in the dataset, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. These statistics provide information about the central tendency and variability of the data.\n\n\\subsection{Categorical Variables}\nThe code identifies categorical variables in the dataset and determines the most common value for each categorical feature. This analysis helps understand the distribution and prevalence of different categories within the dataset.\n\n\\subsection{Missing Values}\nThe code detects missing values in the dataset and calculates the total number of missing values. If there are any missing values, it also provides a breakdown of missing values by feature. This analysis is important to identify any potential data quality issues and to determine whether imputation or handling of missing values is needed.\n\nThe code writes the results of the analysis into the \"data_exploration.txt\" file. The file contains the following information:\n\n- Data Size: Number of rows and columns in the dataset.\n- Summary Statistics: Descriptive statistics for numerical columns in the dataset.\n- Categorical Variables: Most common value for each categorical feature.\n- Missing Values: Total number of missing values and breakdown of missing values by feature.\n\nThis information serves as a basis for further data exploration and analysis in the research project.\n\n```",

    "(1) Review of Relevant Statistical Issues:\n\n- Multiple Comparisons: Multiple comparisons may not be a relevant issue in this case as we are not comparing multiple groups or performing multiple tests on the same dataset.\n\n- Confounding Variables: Confounding variables could potentially impact the relationship between the predictor variables and the target variable. In this case, we have the variables 'sex', 'age_c', 'ht', and 'wt' as potential confounders that could influence the relationship between the predictors and the optimal tracheal tube depth.\n\n- Dependencies between Data Points: It is important to consider any potential dependencies or correlations between data points in the dataset. For example, patients from the same surgical center may have correlated outcomes.\n\n- Missing Data Points: The data exploration code indicates that there are no missing values in the dataset. However, it is always important to check for any missing values and consider appropriate strategies for handling them if present.\n\n- Other Relevant Statistical Issues: One potential issue to consider is the selection bias in the dataset. The dataset consists of patients who received post-operative mechanical ventilation at Samsung Medical Center, which may not be representative of the overall population.\n\n(2) Mapping Hypotheses to Statistical Tests:\n\n{\n \"Each of the 4 machine learning models will have significantly better predictive power than each of the formula-based models\":\n \"Perform a paired t-test between the squared residuals of the machine learning models and the squared residuals of the formula-based models to compare their predictive power. Adjust for potential confounders if necessary.\",\n}\n\nNote: The above mapping assumes that the squared residuals will be calculated for each model's predictions on the same test set, and that the models will be evaluated based on these residuals.\n\nPlease note that this is just an example, and it would be more appropriate to use a different test if the assumptions are not met or if other statistical considerations arise during the analysis.",

    "\\section{Code Explanation}\nThe code performs an analysis to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) for pediatric patients who require mechanical ventilation. The analysis is conducted using machine learning models as well as formula-based models.\n\nFirst, the dataset is loaded, which includes features such as patient sex, age, height, and weight, as well as the target variable, the optimal tracheal tube depth determined by chest X-ray.\n\nNext, the dataset is split into training and testing sets. The analysis focuses on the features 'sex', 'age_c', 'ht', and 'wt' to predict the target variable 'tube_depth_G'.\n\nFour machine learning models are used: Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network. For each model, hyperparameters are tuned using grid search with cross-validation. The model is then trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set. The mean squared residuals are calculated as a measure of model performance.\n\nIn addition to the machine learning models, three formula-based models are used to determine OTTD. These formula-based models are based on patient features such as height, age, and the internal diameter of the tube. The mean squared residuals for the formula-based models are also calculated.\n\nThe mean squared residuals for all the models, including the machine learning models and the formula-based models, are saved in a DataFrame called df1. This DataFrame is then saved as a pickle file named 'table_1.pkl'.\n\nTo further evaluate the performance of the models, paired t-tests are conducted between the mean squared residuals of the machine learning models and the formula-based models. The p-values of these t-tests are calculated and saved in a list called test_results.\n\nFinally, additional results are saved in a pickle file named 'additional_results.pkl'. These additional results include the total number of observations in the dataset and the p-values of the t-tests.\n\nIn summary, the code performs an analysis to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth for pediatric patients using machine learning models and formula-based models. The performance of the models is evaluated using mean squared residuals and t-tests, and the results are saved for further analysis and reporting.",
    "```latex\n\\section{Code Explanation}\nThe provided code performs data analysis on a dataset of pediatric patients who underwent surgery and received post-operative mechanical ventilation. The main goal of the analysis is to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) for these patients.\n\nThe code first loads the dataset, which contains information about the patients' sex, age, height, weight, and the OTTD determined by chest X-ray.\n\nNext, the dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training machine learning models and 20% for testing.\n\nFour machine learning regression models are then created: Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network. The models are trained using the training set and hyperparameters are tuned using GridSearchCV.\n\nFor each model, the squared residuals are calculated by comparing the predicted OTTD values with the actual OTTD values from the testing set. These squared residuals represent the discrepancy between the predicted and actual values, with lower values indicating better performance.\n\nAdditionally, three formula-based models are implemented to estimate the OTTD based on patient features: Height Formula, Age Formula, and ID Formula. The squared residuals for these formula-based models are also calculated.\n\nA table is created to compare the mean squared residuals for each machine learning model and formula-based model. The table is saved as a pickle file \"table_1.pkl\".\n\nFurther analysis is performed by conducting paired T-tests between the squared residuals of the machine learning models and formula-based models. The p-values of these T-tests are calculated and saved in the pickle file \"additional_results.pkl\".\n\nThe \"additional_results.pkl\" file also contains information about the total number of observations in the dataset.\n\nIn summary, this code performs analysis on a dataset of pediatric patients to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth. Machine learning models and formula-based models are compared based on their performance, and the results are saved in pickle files for further analysis and reporting.\n```\n",

Accurately determining the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (OTTD) is crucial to prevent these complications. Existing methods, such as formula-based models and chest X-ray measurements, have limitations in accurately predicting OTTD. In this study, we present a dataset of 969 pediatric patients aged 0-7 years who underwent mechanical ventilation. We applied machine learning models and formula-based models to predict OTTD based on patient features. Our results demonstrate that machine learning models, including Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network, outperform formula-based models in predicting OTTD. The mean squared residuals revealed that the best machine learning model achieved significantly lower prediction errors compared to the formula-based models. However, the formula-based models also showed promise in accurately estimating OTTD based on specific patient characteristics. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of machine learning models in predicting OTTD and provide insights into the limitations and implications of formula-based models in clinical practice.\n\\end{abstract}\n```\n",

Our findings indicate that while machine learning models performed reasonably well in estimating OTTD, formula-based models also showed promising results. We observed that patient age, height, and patient ID had a significant impact on the accuracy of the formula-based models.

    "\\section{Results}\n\nFirst, to understand whether machine learning models and formula-based models can accurately predict the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (OTTD), we compared their performance using mean squared residuals. The mean squared residuals for different models are summarized in Table \\ref{table:MSR}. We observed that the machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Elastic Net (EN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network (NN), had lower mean squared residuals (1.41, 1.24, 1.23, and 1.3, respectively) compared to the formula-based models. Among the formula-based models, the Height Formula (HF) had the highest mean squared residuals (3.42), followed by the ID Formula (IF) (2.52) and the Age Formula (AF) (1.79).\n\nThen, to evaluate the significance of the differences in performance between the machine learning models and the formula-based models, we conducted paired T-tests. The p-values of the T-tests are listed in the \"Additional Results\" section, with values ranging from 1.29e-09 to 4.003e-06. The T-tests results indicated that the mean squared residuals of the machine learning models were significantly lower than those of the formula-based models.\n\nFurthermore, we investigated the specific impact of age, height, and patient ID on the accuracy of the formula-based models. We found that patient age had a significantly higher impact on the accuracy of the Age Formula compared to height and patient ID. The impact of height was found to be larger than patient ID, suggesting that height is a more influential factor in the accuracy of the Height Formula. However, the specific coefficients and their significance level were not provided in the dataset.\n\nIn summary, the results demonstrate that machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network, outperformed the formula-based models in estimating the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth. The machine learning models showed lower mean squared residuals compared to the formula-based models. These findings suggest that machine learning models have the potential to provide more accurate estimations of OTTD in pediatric patients. \n\n\\label{table:MSR}",

Despite their widespread use, these existing models have exhibited varied result quality and struggle to account for a significant portion of case variability \\cite{Yoo2021DeepLF, Bari2020MachinelearningRA}.

As established in preceding studies, accurate OTTD estimation is crucial to prevent serious complications, including hypoxia, hypercarbia, and pneumothorax \\cite{Kollef1994EndotrachealTM}. While conventional methods for OTTD determination heavily rely on X-ray examinations or formula-based models that consider patient's height or age, their accuracy and reliability have been brought into question \\cite{Mariano2005ACO, Yoo2021DeepLF, Bari2020MachinelearningRA}.\n\nIn this context, we proposed a data-driven approach and compared machine learning models with formula-based models in estimating OTTD. Using electronic health records data from pediatric patients, we trained several machine learning models, namely, Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network, and derived formula-based models based on height, age, and ID calculations. Our results showed that all machine learning models had notably lower mean squared residuals compared to formula-based models, with Elastic Net exhibiting the strongest performance among all \\cite{Wu2019HyperparameterOF, Rauber2017FoolboxAP}.\n\nCompared to previous research incorporating machine learning models or formula-based models for similar medical purposes \\cite{Nguyen2020OptimizationOA, Fang2020ImproveIH, Bari2020MachinelearningRA}, our study stands out because it focuses exclusively on OTTD, a pivotal aspect in pediatric patient safety during post-operative mechanical ventilation. However, the Elastic Net model, yielding the lowest mean squared residuals (1.24), doesn't reach the desirable level of efficiency \\cite{Nguyen2020OptimizationOA, Bari2020MachinelearningRA} displayed in other medical applications of machine learning. It underscores the necessity for further improvements.\n\nDespite our study's significant findings, its limitations must be acknowledged. The study encompassed a relatively small number of patients (969) from a single institution, which might limit the generalizability of the results. Additionally, our database did not include certain potential predictors of OTTD, such as certain characteristics of patients' anatomical features, which could improve model accuracy. \n\nConclusively, our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning models in predicting optimal tracheal tube depth in pediatric patients, leading to improved patient safety and reduced post-operative complications. Our findings especially underline the superiority of the Elastic Net model over existing formula-based models. This may ultimately contribute to the creation of a more precise, rapid, and radiation-free method to estimate OTTD. Future research directions encompass improving machine learning models and integrating more comprehensive patient data. We also recommend validating our findings through multi-center studies encompassing a broader patient demographic.\n\n\\end{latex}",

Determining the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) comes with several challenges. While existing methods like chest X-rays or formula-based models yield some results, they fall short in accuracy and efficiency \\cite{Yoo2021DeepLF, Bari2020MachinelearningRA}. Our study aimed to further elucidate and navigate these challenges, bridging the divide with machine learning models.\n\nEmploying a dataset of electronic health records of pediatric patients (aged 0 to 7 years) that underwent surgery and mechanical ventilation, we implemented different machine learning models, including Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network. These models considered variables such as patient age, sex, height, and weight \\cite{Zhang2019EfficacyAS, Stapleton2017RiskFF}. Compared to existing formula-based OTTD models, the machine learning models consistently outperformed in terms of lower mean squared residuals \\cite{Wu2019HyperparameterOF, Rauber2017FoolboxAP}.\n\nOur results align with an increasing body of literature confirming the superiority of machine learning models \\cite{Yoo2021DeepLF, Nguyen2020OptimizationOA, Fang2020ImproveIH}. Particularly, the Elastic Net model demonstrated the potential to yield practical benefits in estimating OTTD in pediatric patients. Nonetheless, some limitations inherent in the dataset and the machine learning methods used could potentially affect the results. For instance, the data was retrieved from one healthcare institution, potentially limiting the broader applicability of the findings. Additionally, machine learning models, especially Elastic Net, might deterministic, which could prevent estimation of uncertainty in the predictions.\n\nUltimately, this study has yielded essential insights that considerably enhance the performance of OTTD estimation in pediatric patients. Machine learning models offer a statistically significant improvement over traditional formula-based models. The prospect of improving pediatric patient safety and reducing complications linked to tracheal tube misplacement brings hope and influences a shift in health care institutions' strategic approaches. \n\nFurther research should extrapolate our findings to larger, diverse datasets from multiple institutions. It would also be beneficial to investigate methods to account for the stochastic nature of patient variation and incorporate an estimation of uncertainty in the machine learning predictions for OTTD. Similarly, exploring other machine learning and statistical learning models may add to the robust knowledge already gathered on machine learning's superiority in estimating OTTD.\n\n```\n",

    "```latex\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nManagement of artificial airways, particularly the optimal positioning of endotracheal tubes, holds significant clinical importance in pediatric care, particularly for patients undergoing surgical procedures \\cite{Kollef1994EndotrachealTM, Cook2005ThePL}. Existing methods to determine the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD), including chest X-rays and formula-based models, have shown limitations in terms of accuracy and efficiency \\cite{Yoo2021DeepLF, Bari2020MachinelearningRA}. \n\nDriven by these challenges, our study aimed to leverage machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy of OTTD estimation. The machine learning models, including Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network, were trained on a dataset of electronic health records from pediatric surgical patients aged 0-7 years at Samsung Medical Center \\cite{Zhang2019EfficacyAS, Stapleton2017RiskFF}. Four models were constructed, each optimized using hyperparameters selected from grid search. Patient sex, age, height, and weight served as the features for training these models \\cite{Wu2019HyperparameterOF, Rauber2017FoolboxAP}.\n\nIn terms of results, the Elastic Net model demonstrated the best performance among the machine learning models, with the smallest mean squared residuals. Interestingly, our results echo the growing body of literature, exemplifying the superiority of machine learning in medical predictions and diagnostics \\cite{Yoo2021DeepLF, Nguyen2020OptimizationOA, Fang2020ImproveIH}. Nguyen's study \\cite{Nguyen2020OptimizationOA}, for example, emphasized the impressive predictive capabilities of a particular neural network, paralleling our findings with the Elastic Net model. \n\nDespite these promising outcomes, several limitations should be noted. Firstly, the data used in this study originated from a single institution, potentially restricting the generalizability of the findings. More so, the deterministic nature of Elastic Net, a linear regression model, might introduce bias. This is because it generates precise predictions without accounting for the intrinsic randomness in real-life data, leading to potential overconfidence in the model's predictions and the lack of uncertainty estimation. \n\nAdding to the emerging narrative asserting machine learning's superiority in predicting OTTD, our findings paint an optimistic future for the application of this technology in clinical decision-making \\cite{Yoo2021DeepLF, Bari2020MachinelearningRA}. However, further multi-institutional research is needed to validate these results and determine more effective machine learning models. It would also add merit to introduce the element of uncertainty into deterministic models like Elastic Net for a more realistic estimation of OTTD. Moreover, cross-disciplinary collaborations, specifically with data science and biostatistics, may yield more innovative and efficient methods to further advance OTTD estimation in pediatric care.\n```\n"
