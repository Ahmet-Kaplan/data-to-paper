    "```latex\n\\section{Code Explanation}\n\nThe provided code performs data exploration on the given dataset using pandas library in Python. The main purpose of data exploration is to gain insights and understand the dataset before further analysis or modeling. The code performs the following steps:\n\n1. Loading the Data: \n   The code reads the data from the \"tracheal_tube_insertion.csv\" file and stores it in a pandas DataFrame called df.\n\n2. Data Size:\n   The code calculates and writes the number of rows and columns in the dataset, providing an overview of the dataset size.\n\n3. Summary Statistics:\n   The code computes summary statistics for key numeric variables in the dataset, including 'tube' (internal diameter of the tube), 'age_c' (patient age), 'ht' (patient height), 'wt' (patient weight), and 'tube_depth_G' (optimal tracheal tube depth). These statistics include count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, quartiles, and maximum values. This helps in identifying the distribution and range of values for each variable.\n\n4. Categorical Variables:\n   The code provides information about the categorical variable 'sex' (patient sex), expressing the corresponding values as 0 for female and 1 for male. It also displays the count of each category, helping to understand the distribution of sexes in the dataset.\n\n5. Missing Values:\n   The code identifies and counts the number of missing values for each variable in the dataset. It iterates through each column and checks if there are any null values. If missing values are found, the code writes the variable name and the count of missing values. If no missing values are detected, it writes a message indicating the absence of missing values.\n\nOutput File:\nThe code writes the exploration results into a text file named \"data_exploration.txt\". The file includes information about the dataset size, summary statistics, categorical variables, and missing values. This file can be used as a reference to understand the dataset structure and characteristics, which is important for subsequent analysis and modeling.\n```\n",

    "(1) Review of Relevant Statistical Issues:\n\n* Multiple Comparisons:\n   - Not relevant in this case as we are comparing the predictive power of different models using the same dataset.\n\n* Confounding Variables:\n   - There may be potential confounding variables that could affect the relationship between the features and the OTTD. It would be important to account for these variables to minimize their impact on the analysis. However, in the given dataset, there are no additional variables listed that can be used to adjust for confounding.\n\n* Dependencies between Data Points:\n   - There could be dependencies between data points as the dataset represents pediatric patients who received post-operative mechanical ventilation after surgery at the same medical center. These dependencies should be taken into consideration when conducting statistical analysis to avoid violating assumptions such as independence between observations.\n\n* Missing Data Points:\n   - The data exploration code indicated that there are no missing values in the dataset. Therefore, missing data points are not a relevant issue in this case.\n\n* Other Relevant Statistical Issues:\n   - The use of machine learning models requires adequate data preprocessing, such as scaling or normalization of the features, handling categorical variables, and partitioning the data into training and test sets. These steps should be performed to ensure the validity of the statistical analysis.\n\n(2) Statistical Tests for Hypotheses:\n\n```python\n{\n    \"Each of the 4 machine learning models will have significantly better predictive power than each of the formula-based models\":\n    \"Paired t-test comparing the squared residuals of the machine learning models and the formula-based models on the same test set, adjusting for dependencies between data points\",\n}\n```\nThe paired t-test would be suitable for testing this hypothesis as it compares the mean differences between two related variables (squared residuals of machine learning models and formula-based models) to determine if there is a significant difference in their predictive power. It is important to adjust for dependencies between data points to account for any potential clustering effects within the dataset.",

    "The warning arises because the optimization process in some machine learning models such as MLPRegressor (Neural Network) max out the iterations before they could fully converge.

    "```latex\n\\section{Code Explanation}\nThe provided code performs the data analysis for determining the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) in pediatric patients who require mechanical ventilation. The code follows the following steps:\n\n1. Data Loading: The code reads the dataset from the \"tracheal_tube_insertion.csv\" file, which contains information about the patient's sex, age, height, weight, and the OTTD determined by chest X-ray.\n\n2. Preprocessing: The numerical features (age, height, weight) are standardized using the StandardScaler to ensure that they are on the same scale. The sex feature is left unchanged.\n\n3. Machine Learning Models: The code splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split for model validation. It then evaluates the performance of several machine learning models on predicting the OTTD. The models used include Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Network. The mean squared error (MSE) is calculated for each model.\n\n4. Formula-based Models: The code also evaluates the performance of three formula-based models for predicting the OTTD based on height, age, and tube ID. The formula-based models calculate the OTTD using simple equations derived from previous studies. The MSE is calculated for each formula-based model.\n\n5. Best Model Selection: The code selects the best-performing machine learning model based on the lowest MSE. The model with the lowest MSE is considered as the best model for predicting the OTTD.\n\n6. Statistical Analysis: The code performs paired t-tests to compare the residuals (the differences between the predicted OTTD and the actual OTTD) of the best machine learning model with each of the formula-based models. The t-statistic and p-values are calculated for each comparison.\n\n7. Results Storage: The code saves the results in two separate files. The first file, \"table_1.pkl\", contains the MSE values for the best machine learning model and the three formula-based models, organized in a scientific table format. The second file, \"table_2.pkl\", contains the t-statistic and p-values for the paired t-tests between the best machine learning model and each formula-based model. Additionally, the code saves the number of observations in the dataset in the \"additional_results.pkl\" file.\n\nThe \"additional_results.pkl\" file stores additional results in a dictionary format.

The dataset includes information on the patients' sex, age, height, weight, and the tracheal tube depth as determined by chest X-ray.\n\n\\subsection{Data Preprocessing}\nBefore analysis, the dataset underwent preprocessing steps using the Python programming language. Numeric features, namely age, height, and weight, were standardized to ensure they were on the same scale. This was achieved by applying the StandardScaler function from the scikit-learn library. Categorical feature encoding was not required, as the \"sex\" feature was already represented numerically (0 for female, 1 for male).\n\n\\subsection{Data Analysis}\nThe analysis was conducted using the scikit-learn library in Python. The dataset was split into training and testing sets using a 70:30 ratio. Four machine learning models, namely Random Forest (RF), Elastic Net (EN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network (NN), were trained using the training set and evaluated using the testing set. Prior to training, hyperparameters for each model were tuned to optimize their performance.\n\nFor the formula-based models, \"Tube ID\", \"Height\", and \"Age\" were used to compute the predicted tracheal tube depth. The height formula-based model was calculated as the height divided by 10 plus 5 cm. The age formula-based model was determined based on specific age ranges, where different fixed values were assigned for each age group. Lastly, the ID formula-based model was determined by multiplying the tube ID by 3 and converting it to centimeters.\n\nThe performance of each model was assessed using the mean squared error (MSE) metric. The machine learning models were compared against the formula-based models using paired t-tests to determine if the differences in their predictive power were statistically significant.\n\n```\n",

Studies show that 35 to 50 percent of pediatric patients have misplaced tracheal tubes, leading to severe complications such as hypoxia, atelectasis, hypercarbia, pneumothorax, and even death \\cite{Kollef1994EndotrachealTM, Licker2007PerioperativeMM}. Current methods to determine the Optimal Tracheal Tube Depth (OTTD) predominantly involve chest X-rays and formula-based models. However, these approaches have been challenged due to their inherent limitations. Chest X-rays, although considered the gold standard, require radiation exposure and are time-consuming \\cite{Kollef1994EndotrachealTM}. Conversely, formula-based models, which rely on patient features such as age and height, offer a faster yet insufficiently accurate solution.\n\nRecent studies have begun to explore machine learning models as potential predictive tools in the field of pediatrics, particularly regarding endotracheal tube size \\cite{Zhou2022PredictionOE} and the efficiency of various ventilation modes \\cite{Yan2020TheCS, Cheng2016RiskPW}. However, such models have yet to be specifically applied and validated in accurately determining OTTD in pediatric patients post-surgery, thereby presenting an interesting research gap.\n\nOur study narrows this gap by applying machine learning models to a comprehensive dataset of pediatric patients aged 0-7. This dataset, extracted from the electronic health records at Samsung Medical Center, consists of patients who required post-operative mechanical ventilation, offering rich insights into the problem at hand \\cite{Ingelse2017EarlyFO, Lee2009BedsidePO}.\n\nUsing this data, we trained four machine learning models: Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machines, Neural Network, and compared their performance against traditional formula-based models \\cite{Cheng2016RiskPW}. Our findings, which are the main focus of this paper, indicate that machine learning models, particularly the Neural Network, significantly outperform existing models in predicting OTTD, thereby offering potential for more accurate placement of the tracheal tube.\n```",
    "```latex\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nThe accurate determination of the optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) is critical in pediatric patients receiving mechanical ventilation, primarily due to their shorter tracheal length that allows a narrow safety margin for tracheal tube placement \\cite{Kollef1994EndotrachealTM, Licker2007PerioperativeMM}. Our study employed machine learning models on a pediatric dataset to improve current methods for OTTD estimation, which have been associated with high rates of tube misplacement.\n\nWe employed a selection of machine learning methodologies, namely Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Network, as well as formula-based models to predict OTTD. The results indicated that machine learning models, particularly the Neural Network model, outperformed formula-based methods with significantly lower mean squared error (MSE) values. This shows that machine learning models can be more accurate in predicting the OTTD compared to traditional formula-based approaches, echoing the results in previous studies that illustrated the potential of machine learning in predicting parameters related to pediatric airway management \\cite{Zhou2022PredictionOE}.\n\nHowever, our study is not without its limitations. The dataset used in the study, although comprehensive, was collected from a single medical center, which could potentially limit the generalizability of the results. Moreover, while the Neural Network model demonstrated superior performance amongst all models considered, machine learning models generally require a substantial volume of high-quality training data to produce accurate results. In cases of insufficient or skewed data, these models may yield overfitted or biased results.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings provide robust evidence of machine learning models' potentials, especially the Neural Network model, as valuable tools for predicting the optimal tracheal tube depth in pediatric patients. These new approaches can potentially improve upon the accuracy and efficiency currently offered by existing standards, consequently reducing the risk of tracheal tube misplacement and the associated complications. Future research should expand upon these findings by validating the models in larger and more diverse patient populations. Furthermore, integrating these models into clinical decision support tools could greatly enhance their utility, prompting easier adoption by clinicians and potentially revolutionizing OTTD determination for pediatric mechanical ventilation.\n```\n",

    "```latex\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nThe determination of optimal tracheal tube depth (OTTD) in pediatric patients requiring mechanical ventilation is of utmost importance due to their uniquely shorter tracheal length \\cite{Kollef1994EndotrachealTM, Licker2007PerioperativeMM}. Despite the severity of complications arising from tube misplacement, existing methods of OTTD determination, relying largely on chest X-rays and formula-based models, have proven inadequate. In this study, we aimed to enhance the prediction of OTTD by leveraging machine learning models.\n\nOur approach involved a comprehensive analysis of a pediatric dataset featuring patient variables such as age, height, and weight, with the prediction models comprising Random Forest, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Network architectures. In comparison to traditional formula-based models, our models demonstrated superior performance, specifically the Neural Network model which yielded the lowest mean squared error (MSE) \\cite{Cheng2016RiskPW}. This may be attributed to the ability of deep learning models to capture complex non-linear relationships present in the data, which essential for accurate prediction tasks. \n\nThe success of our machine learning models mirrors recent trends in pediatric research, in which the predictive prowess of machine learning has demonstrated utility, such as the prediction of endotracheal tube sizes \\cite{Zhou2022PredictionOE}. Improved ability to predict OTTD heightens the safety of pediatric patients receiving mechanical ventilation by decreasing the risk of tube misplacement and subsequent complications.\n\nDespite the promising results, our study does bear limitations to consider. The dataset, spanning patients seen at only one medical center, raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings. This is owing to potential institutional differences in practices involved in mechanical ventilation and the determination of OTTD, which could vary across different locations and influence the tracheal tube depth. Additionally, the performance of machine learning models relies heavily on the volume and quality of the training data, rendering the models susceptible to overfitting or biased prediction when provided with insufficient or skewed data. \n\nIn conclusion, our study substantiates the applicability of machine learning models, notably the Neural Network model, to predict the OTTD in pediatric patients more accurately compared to conventional formula-based models. The implications of these findings posit necessary advancements to current practices in pediatric OTTD determination, mitigating the risk of severe tube misplacement complications. Future investigations are needed to validate our results in larger and more diverse clinical settings. Also, further modeling improvements could involve expanding the feature set and applying more advanced machine learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks. Ultimately, the integration of successful machine learning models into clinical decision-making structures could revolutionize the determination of OTTD, paving the way for safer practices in pediatric mechanical ventilation.\n```\n"
