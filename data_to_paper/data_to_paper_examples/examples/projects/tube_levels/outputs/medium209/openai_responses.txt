    "\\section{Code Explanation}\n\nThe provided code performs data exploration on the original dataset \"tracheal_tube_insertion.csv\". The dataset consists of 969 rows (patients) and 6 columns.\n\nThe code starts by loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame, `df`. It then creates an output text file, \"data_exploration.txt\", to store the results of the exploration.\n\nThe code performs the following analysis steps:\n\n\\subsection{Data Size}\nThe code calculates and writes the number of rows and columns in the dataset.\n\n\\subsection{Summary Statistics}\nDescriptive statistics are computed for the numerical columns in the dataset using the `describe()` function. This includes measures such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. The results are then written to the output file.\n\n\\subsection{Categorical Variables}\nThe code analyzes the distribution of the categorical variable \"sex\" (patient sex) using the `value_counts()` function. The counts of each category (0=female, 1=male) are computed and written to the output file.\n\n\\subsection{Missing Values}\nThe code checks for missing values in the dataset using the `isnull().sum()` function. The number of missing values in each column is calculated and written to the output file.\n\n\\subsection{Checking for Unusual Values}\nTo check for unusual numeric values in the dataset, the code counts the occurrences of zero in the columns \"age_c\", \"ht\", \"wt\", and \"tube_depth_G\". This is done using the statement `(df[['age_c', 'ht', 'wt', 'tube_depth_G']] == 0).sum()`. The counts of zero values in these columns are then written to the output file.\n\nThe output of the code is written to the \"data_exploration.txt\" file, which includes the data size, summary statistics, distribution of categorical variables, missing values, and counts of unusual zero values. This information provides an initial understanding of the dataset and can aid in further analysis and modeling.",

Categorical Variables:\n   - The code calculates the distribution of the \"sex\" variable (patient sex) in the dataset using the value_counts() function.\n   - The distribution counts are written to the \"data_exploration.txt\" file.\n\n4. Missing Values:\n   - The code calculates the number of missing values in each column of the dataset using the isnull().sum() function.\n   - The missing value counts are written to the \"data_exploration.txt\" file.\n\n5. Checking for Unusual Numeric Values:\n   - The code checks for any zero values in the columns \"age_c\" (patient age), \"ht\" (patient height), \"wt\" (patient weight), and \"tube_depth_G\" (optimal tracheal tube depth).\n   - If zero values are found, they are written to the \"data_exploration.txt\" file.\n\nThe \"data_exploration.txt\" file will contain the results of the data exploration analysis, including the number of rows and columns, summary statistics, sex distribution, missing value counts, and zero value counts (if applicable).

    "(1) Relevant Statistical Issues:\n\n* Multiple comparisons: Since we have specified two models (machine-learning model and formula-based model) and we are comparing their predictive power, we are conducting multiple comparisons. This can lead to an increased chance of making a Type I error. Therefore, we should account for multiple comparisons by adjusting our significance level or using appropriate correction methods, such as Bonferroni correction or False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction.\n\n* Confounding variables: In our dataset, we have several potential confounding variables such as sex, age, height, and weight. These variables may be associated with both the predictors and the outcome variable. Therefore, we should adjust for these confounding variables to avoid biased results.\n\n* Dependencies between data points: It is important to check for dependencies between data points to ensure the independence assumption for statistical tests is met. In our analysis, we need to ensure that each patient's data is independent of the others.\n\n* Missing data points: We should check for missing data points in the dataset and handle them appropriately. Missing data can introduce bias and affect the results of our analysis. If there are missing values, we may need to consider imputation techniques or use appropriate statistical methods that handle missing data.\n\n* Other relevant statistical issues: In our case, it is important to consider the distributional assumptions of the statistical tests we use. For example, if we choose to perform a linear regression, we need to check if the assumptions of linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality hold.\n\n(2) Adequate Statistical Tests:\n\n{\n \"The machine-learning model will have a significantly better predictive power than the formula-based model (as measured by their squared residuals on the same test set)\":\n \"Paired t-test with the squared residuals of the machine-learning model and the formula-based model while accounting for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction. We should include the confounding variables (sex, age, height, and weight) as covariates in the model. We should also check for dependencies between data points and handle missing data appropriately.\",\n}\n\nNote: We are only testing one hypothesis in this case, which compares the predictive power of the machine-learning model and the formula-based model. Therefore, there is only one statistical test mentioned in the dictionary.",

The analysis involves the following steps:\n\n1. Loading the data: The code reads the \"tracheal_tube_insertion.csv\" file, which contains a dataset of pediatric patients' characteristics (sex, age, height, and weight) and the corresponding OTTD determined by chest X-ray.\n\n2. Data preparation: No additional dataset preparations are needed in this analysis.\n\n3. Preprocessing: No preprocessing steps are required for this analysis.\n\n4. Analysis:\n   a) Splitting the data: The dataset is split into independent variables (patient characteristics) represented by X and the dependent variable (OTTD) represented by y.\n   \n   b) Train-test split: The data is further divided into training and testing sets using a 80:20 split ratio.\n   \n   c) Random Forest model: A Random Forest regressor is initialized and fitted to the training data to predict the OTTD based on the patient characteristics.\n   \n   d) Formula-based model: The OTTD is calculated using a simple formula based on the patient's height.\n   \n   e) Mean Squared Error (MSE): The MSE is calculated for both the Random Forest model and the formula-based model, which provides a measure of the predictive accuracy of each model.\n   \n   f) Paired t-test: A paired t-test is performed to compare the predicted OTTD values from the Random Forest model and the formula-based model. The t-test assesses whether there is a significant difference in the performance of the two models.\n   \n5. Saving results: The results of the analysis, specifically the MSE values and the p-value from the t-test, are saved in a pickle file named \"table_1.pkl\" as a pandas dataframe. Additionally, the t-statistic and the p-value from the t-test are saved in a separate pickle file named \"additional_results.pkl\".\n\nThis analysis aims to evaluate the performance of the Random Forest model compared to the formula-based model in predicting the optimal tracheal tube depth for pediatric patients. The results provide insights into the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms for improving the accuracy of OTTD determination, potentially reducing the risks associated with misplaced tracheal tubes in pediatric patients.\n```\n",

We compared the predictive performance of a machine-learning model, Random Forest (RF) Model, against a formula-based model commonly used in clinical practice to evaluate if the RF Model can outperform the formula-based model.\n\nThe RF Model was trained using the Random Forest algorithm and utilized patient features such as sex, age, height, and weight to predict OTTD. In contrast, the formula-based model estimated OTTD based solely on patient height using the formula OTTD = height (cm) / 10 + 5 cm. The motivation behind this analysis was to determine if the RF Model, with its ability to capture more complex relationships between features, could provide more accurate predictions of OTTD compared to the formula-based model.\n\nOur analysis revealed that the RF Model significantly outperformed the formula-based model in predicting OTTD in pediatric patients. The RF Model exhibited a significantly lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 1.6, compared to the formula-based model's MSE of 3.42 \\ref{table:comparison_of_prediction_models}.

The null hypothesis stated that there was no significant difference in the predictive performance of the two models, while the alternative hypothesis posited that the RF Model would have superior predictive performance.

By reducing complications associated with tracheal tube misplacement, such as hypoxia, atelectasis, hypercarbia, and pneumothorax, the RF Model has the potential to improve patient safety during mechanical ventilation. The RF Model's ability to capture more nuanced relationships between patient features and OTTD may help guide clinicians in positioning tracheal tubes accurately, minimizing the risks of adverse events.\n\nIn summary, our comparative analysis demonstrated that the RF Model, trained using the Random Forest algorithm, surpassed the formula-based model in accurately predicting OTTD in pediatric patients. With a significantly lower MSE and superior predictive performance, the RF Model shows promise for enhancing patient safety and reducing complications associated with tracheal tube misplacement during mechanical ventilation.```\n",
