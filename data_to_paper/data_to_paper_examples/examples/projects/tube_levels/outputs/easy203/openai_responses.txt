Data Size:\n   The code determines and writes the number of rows and columns in the dataset, providing an overview of the dataset's size.\n\n2. Summary Statistics:\n   The code calculates and writes the summary statistics of the dataset, which includes measures such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum for each numerical column in the dataset. This provides a quantitative description of the distribution and central tendencies of the dataset.\n\n3. Categorical Variables:\n   Assuming the \"sex\" column is the only categorical variable, the code groups the dataset by sex and calculates the counts for each category. It then writes the resulting counts into the output file. This analysis provides insight into the distribution of the categorical variable in the dataset.\n\n4. Missing Values:\n   The code checks for missing values in the dataset and writes the number of missing values for each column into the output file. This analysis helps identify any missing data that may need to be addressed before further analysis or modeling.\n\nThe output text file, \"data_exploration.txt\", includes the results of the data exploration analysis mentioned above. This file can be used for reference and documentation purposes, providing a summary of the dataset's key characteristics and properties.\n\nOverall, this code provides a systematic analysis of the dataset, allowing researchers to understand the data's structure, distributions, and potential data quality issues, thus enabling informed decision-making for subsequent steps in data analysis and modeling.\n```\n",

We should adjust for these variables in our analysis.\n- Dependencies between Data Points: We need to check if there are any dependencies between data points, such as repeated measurements on the same individuals or clustering effects. If present, we should account for them in our analysis.\n- Missing Data Points: The data exploration code and output did not indicate any missing values in the dataset.

The analysis is based on a dataset containing patient information such as sex, age, height, and weight, as well as the OTTD determined by chest X-ray.\n\nThe code begins by loading the dataset and preparing the data for analysis by separating the features (sex, age, height, and weight) and the target variable (OTTD). The dataset is then split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in three major steps:\n1. Random Forest and Elastic Net model performance comparison:\n   - The code tunes the hyperparameters of the Random Forest and Elastic Net models using GridSearchCV, optimizing the number of estimators and maximum depth for Random Forest, and the alpha and l1_ratio for Elastic Net.\n   - The tuned models are used to make predictions on the testing set, and the mean squared error (MSE) is calculated for each model. These MSE values are used for model comparison.\n   - A T-test is performed on the squared errors of the Random Forest and Elastic Net models to assess if there is a significant difference in their performance.\n\n2. R-squared score comparison:\n   - The code calculates the R-squared score, which indicates the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable by the models. The R-squared scores are computed for both the Random Forest and Elastic Net models on the testing set.\n\n3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) comparison:\n   - The code calculates the RMSE, which provides an easily interpretable estimate of the average prediction error of the models. The RMSE values are computed for both the Random Forest and Elastic Net models on the testing set.\n\nAdditionally, the code saves the results of the analysis in three separate tables, stored as pickled files:\n- \"table_1.pkl\" contains the comparison of Random Forest and Elastic Net model performance, including mean squared error values and the T-test p-value.\n- \"table_2.pkl\" contains the R-squared scores for the Random Forest and Elastic Net models.\n- \"table_3.pkl\" contains the RMSE values for the Random Forest and Elastic Net models.\n\nFurthermore, the code saves additional results in the \"additional_results.pkl\" file, including the total number of observations in the dataset, as well as the mean squared error values for both the Random Forest and Elastic Net models.\n\nThis analysis would help evaluate the effectiveness of the Random Forest and Elastic Net models in predicting the OTTD for pediatric patients, providing insights into which model may be more suitable for clinical use.\n```\n",

We analyzed a dataset of 969 patients aged 0-7 years who received mechanical ventilation at Samsung Medical Center. The dataset included patient features such as sex, age, height, weight, and the OTTD determined by chest X-ray. \n\nFirst, we compared the performance of Random Forest and Elastic Net models in predicting OTTD. The Random Forest model was trained using hyperparameter tuning with a range of n_estimators and max_depth. Similarly, the Elastic Net model was optimized by adjusting the alpha and l1_ratio parameters. The comparison of model performance is summarized in Table \\ref{table:comparison_models}. Both models achieved accurate predictions, with mean squared errors (MSE) of 1.41 for Random Forest and 1.24 for Elastic Net. The paired t-test results revealed no significant difference between the squared residuals of the two models, with a p-value of 0.0533.\n\nNext, we assessed the goodness of fit of the models by calculating the R squared scores. The R squared score represents the proportion of the variance in the OTTD that can be explained by the models. The Random Forest model achieved an R squared score of 0.592, while the Elastic Net model showed a slightly higher R squared score of 0.64. These results are summarized in Table \\ref{table:r_squared}.\n\nFurthermore, we evaluated the accuracy of the models by calculating the root mean squared error (RMSE), which measures the average deviation of the predicted OTTD from the true values. The Random Forest model yielded an RMSE of 1.19, while the Elastic Net model had a slightly lower RMSE of 1.11. The details are presented in Table \\ref{table:root_mse}.\n\nIn summary, our analysis demonstrates that both the Random Forest and Elastic Net models can accurately predict the OTTD in pediatric patients undergoing post-operative mechanical ventilation. The models achieved similar performance in terms of MSE, R squared score, and RMSE. These results provide valuable insights into the potential application of predictive models in improving tracheal tube placement in pediatric patients, ultimately enhancing patient safety and reducing complications.\n```\n",
