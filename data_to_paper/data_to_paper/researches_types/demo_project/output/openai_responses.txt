    "\\title{Unlocking the Comedy of Prime Numbers: A Hilarious Journey to Find the Largest Prime Number Below a Given Natural Number}\n\n\\begin{abstract}\nIn this side-splitting scientific escapade, we embark on a quest to unearth the largest prime number that lurks just below a given natural number, leaving no comedic stone unturned. Armed with our trusty Python code and a twist of madness, we braved the mathematical wilderness and encountered hilarious equations, uproarious algorithms, and a numerically brilliant punchline. Our journey culminated in the discovery of the largest prime number below our chosen natural number of $n = 10000$, which was none other than the hysterically sneaky, side-splittingly witty, and intellectually puzzling number 9973. Join us in this uproariously entertaining quest as we unravel the hidden comedy within our numerical universe and celebrate the absurdity of prime numbers.\n\\end{abstract}",
    "- The title could use a punchier and more attention-grabbing phrase to reflect the comedic aspect of the paper. Consider adding a playful twist to the wording.\n- The abstract does a great job of setting the comedic tone, but it could benefit from a clearer introduction to the research goal and method.\n- It would be helpful to mention the actual number given in the input file, \"n = 10000\", in the abstract to align with the given information.\n- Consider adding a touch of humor to the description of the Python code, perhaps highlighting a hilarious quirk or absurdity in the execution.\n- The abstract could end with a witty closing line that ties back to the overall theme of celebrating the absurdity of prime numbers.",
