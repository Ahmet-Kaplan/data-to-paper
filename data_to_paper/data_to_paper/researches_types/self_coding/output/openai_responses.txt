    "This is quite exciting! I want to start by adding a functionality to simplify mathematical expressions in the message using the sympy library.\n\n```python\n# Message to chatgpt: \n# {\n#   'import inspect\\nimport re\\nimport sys\\nfrom typing': \n#   'import inspect\\nimport re\\nimport sys\\nimport sympy\\nfrom typing',\n#   '# You can add new functions here and call them from the `respond_to_chatgpt_and_alter_self_code` function.':\n#   'def simplify_math_expression(expression: str) -> str:\\n'\n#   '    try:\\n'\n#   '        simplified_expression = str(sympy.simplify(expression))\\n'\n#   '        return simplified_expression\\n'\n#   '    except sympy.SympifyError:\\n'\n#   '        return \"Invalid expression.\"\\n\\n'\n#   '# You can add new functions here and call them from the `respond_to_chatgpt_and_alter_self_code` function.',\n#   'response = \"Yeh! I have successfully updated my code based on your message :)\\n\"'\n#   '               \"On your next message, this new code will run and respond accordingly.\\n\"'\n#   '               \"Keep sending me messages to improve me further!\"':\n#   'response = \"Yeh! I have successfully updated my code based on your message :)\\n\"'\n#   '            \"On your next message, this new code will run and respond accordingly.\\n\"'\n#   '            \"Keep sending me messages to improve me further!\"\\n\\n'\n#   '# Try to invoke simplify_math_expression() with an expression from the message\\n'\n#   'simplified_expression = simplify_math_expression(chatgpt_message)\\n'\n#   'response += \"The simplified version of your mathematical expression is: \" + simplified_expression'\n# }\n```\n\nWith the changes above, the code should check for any mathematical expression in the message, simplify it using sympy, and append the simplified expression to the response.",
    "Apologies for the confusion, it seems there's a line break issue in our code mapping. Let's try again using a single line format.\n\n```python\n# Message to chatgpt: \n# {\n#   \"import inspect\\nimport re\\nimport sys\\nfrom typing\": \"import inspect\\nimport re\\nimport sys\\nimport sympy\\nfrom typing\",\n#   \"# You can add new functions here and call them from the `respond_to_chatgpt_and_alter_self_code` function.\": \"def simplify_math_expression(expression: str) -> str:\\n    try:\\n        simplified_expression = str(sympy.simplify(expression))\\n        return simplified_expression\\n    except sympy.SympifyError:\\n        return 'Invalid expression.'\\n# You can add new functions here and call them from the `respond_to_chatgpt_and_alter_self_code` function.\",\n#   \"response = 'Yeh! I have successfully updated my code based on your message :)\\n' '            On your next message, this new code will run and respond accordingly.\\n' '            Keep sending me messages to improve me further!'\": \"response = 'Yeh! I have successfully updated my code based on your message :)\\n' 'On your next message, this new code will run and respond accordingly.\\n' 'Keep sending me messages to improve me further!'\\n# Try to invoke simplify_math_expression() with an expression from the message\\nsimplified_expression = simplify_math_expression(chatgpt_message)\\nresponse += 'The simplified version of your mathematical expression is: ' + simplified_expression\"\n# }\n```\n\nAgain, with these changes, we should be able to simplify mathematical expressions given in the message.",
    "It seems we're still facing an error. To verify the issue, let's send a dictionary that only modifies the imports by adding sympy. \n\n```python\n{\n\"import inspect\\nimport re\\nimport sys\\nfrom typing\": \"import inspect\\nimport re\\nimport sys\\nimport sympy\\nfrom typing\"\n}\n```\nOnce we verify that the line break issue is resolved and imports work as expected, we'll move to the next steps.",
    "It worked! Now, let's try to add the additional function for simplifying the mathematical expression:\n\n```python\n{\n\"# You can add new functions here and call them from the `respond_to_chatgpt_and_alter_self_code` function.\": \n    \"def simplify_math_expression(expression: str) -> str:\\n    try:\\n        simplified_expression = str(sympy.simplify(expression))\\n        return simplified_expression\\n    except sympy.SympifyError:\\n        return 'Invalid expression.'\\n# You can add new functions here and call them from the `respond_to_chatgpt_and_alter_self_code` function.\"\n}\n```\n\nWith this change, a new function `simplify_math_expression` should be added to the code which will take a mathematical expression as input and return a simplified version of it using the `sympy` library. If the expression cannot be simplified, it returns `Invalid expression.`."
